Rebirth,Gook,What. A pair of sleeping skulls?
Rebirth,Deridovely,"Hehe, I win again! No hard feelings, right?"
Rebirth,Gook,"Hey there, Ryuk, would it kill you to join us? You should come play with us for a change!"
Rebirth,Ryuk,"No, I'll pass."
Rebirth,English teacher,Listen for the voice of God then follow it and know that in time you will find your salvation.
Rebirth,Talking Girl 1,"I know, I didn't even do anything wrong! He just totally snapped at me!"
Rebirth,Talking Girl 2,Really?
Rebirth,Teacher,"Yagami, are you still with us? Can you please translate the following sentence into English?"
Rebirth,Light,[Sigh] Follow the teachings of God and receive his blessings and so it shall be that the seas will again become bountiful and the raging storms will subside.
Rebirth,Newscaster,"Today, at approximately 11 am a 32-year-old man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in the city of Yokohama Karigara Prefecture. Karigawa police are treating this case as a homicide."
Rebirth,Newscaster 2,"In other news, today, suspected murderer Naoki Tokuji was arrested in the district of Shibuya Tokyo. He is being held in custody facing murder charges for the brutal slaying of his common-law partner, who was only 25 at the time of death."
Rebirth,Light,"Day in and day out, the same news on permanent repeat."
Rebirth,Ryuk,This is all so ridiculous.
Rebirth,Light,This world is…
Rebirth,Ryuk,Rotten.
Rebirth,Teacher,Another noticeable consequence is the extinction of many species on the planet. Species are now becoming extinct at a faster rate than has ever occurred in our recorded history.
Rebirth,Chatting boy,No way! You paged [unintelligible]
Rebirth,Light,"Death Note? As in a notebook of death? Hmm. How to use it: the human whose name is written in this notebook… shall die! Hmm. It's pretty lame, not to mention twisted. It's really not that different from one of those chain letters you get. A human whose name is written in this notebook shall die? Come on."
Rebirth,Light,"There must be something wrong with me to even consider it. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his or her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Hmm, so depending on the person you have in mind you can either kill them easily or painfully, huh. This is pretty detailed for a prank, I'll give them that. Hmm… so I write a name and that person… dies. Like anyone would believe that. Ugh! Wait, on the off chance someone really dies, would that make me a murderer? Yeah right, it's completely impossible."
Rebirth,Newscaster 3,"The same assailant who attacked 6 people at a busy shopping district in Sinjuku yesterday has struck again, taking 8 people hostage at this daycare center. His captives include both children and teachers. The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Kuro Otoharada, currently unemployed. We expect negotiations to begin immediately."
Rebirth,Light,"Hmm, a heart attack in 40 seconds? We'll see."
Rebirth,Newscaster 3,"At the present time, that's all the police are telling us."
Rebirth,Newscaster 4,You can't help but feel concerned for the safety of those hostages.
Rebirth,Newscaster 3,You're absolutely right. We'll continue to monitor the situation from here.
Rebirth,Newscaster 4,"Thank you for that report. What do you make of this, Mr. Hashimoto?"
Rebirth,Mr. Hashimoto,"Well, one can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation."
Rebirth,Light,"Looks like the notebook doesn't work. Oh well, I didn't expect it to anyway."
Rebirth,Newscaster 4,"Wait, we're seeing something here! Looks like there's movement at the front entrance!"
Rebirth,Newscaster 3,"The hostages are coming out, and they all look to be unharmed! The Special Forces are taking action; they're moving in! We don't know if the suspect's been arrested. Huh? Yes? Ok, we now have confirmation. The suspect has been found dead inside! I repeat, the suspect is now dead!"
Rebirth,Light,Dead?
Rebirth,Newscaster 3,The Special Forces are denying allegations that they shot the suspect.
Rebirth,Newscaster 4,"So, it's quite possible he was feeling cornered and decided to commit suicide?"
Rebirth,Newscaster 3,"Well, according to statements from hostages the suspect just suddenly collapsed."
Rebirth,Light,A heart attack? No way! It's coincidence! This has to be a coincidence!
Rebirth,Sachiko,"Light! It's already 6:30, you know! Don't you have cram school tonight?"
Rebirth,Light,"Yeah, I'll be ready in just a sec. The Death Note, it's unlikely, but if by chance this thing is for real, I have to test it one more time. In which case, it should probably be another criminal. But if he's too well-known, that will be a problem. If he dies, there's a good possibility that news of his death will be covered up. I need to see results right away."
Rebirth,Sudou,"Hey, Ryo buddy."
Rebirth,Ryo,"What is it, Sudou?"
Rebirth,Sudou,Didn't you want to lend me 20 dollars?
Rebirth,Ryo,"What, again? But I can't do that."
Rebirth,Light,Sudou…
Rebirth,Sudou,You can't…
Rebirth,Light,"Maybe I should try killing him. No, I should definitely avoid killing people I know. Then again, does it even really matter? I mean, would anyone really care if I guy like him was to disappear one day?"
Rebirth,Sudou,"Sweet, looks like we'll be hanging at the arcade after school."
Rebirth,Random Street Girl 1,"We're having a speed dating party tomorrow, you wanna come?"
Rebirth,Random Street Girl 2,"Yeah, of course."
Rebirth,Random Street Girl 3,"Oh yeah, there's no way I'm missing that."
Rebirth,Ryo,"Dammit, why is my mom so useless! She's never here to pick me up on time!"
Rebirth,Light,"Once you actually start looking around, it makes you wonder if you'd be doing society a favor by getting rid of all these people."
Rebirth,Takuo,"Hey baby, where you going? Come have a little fun with us!"
Rebirth,Henchman 1,That's our Takuo for ya. This guy can spot a hottie a mile away.
Rebirth,Takuo,"What's up, little lady? The name's Takuo Shibuimaru. What do ya say? Come hang out with us, pretty lady."
Rebirth,Lady,"Please, I don't want any trouble."
Rebirth,Henchman 1,You hear that? She doesn't want trouble.
Rebirth,Henchman 2,Isn't that cute.
Rebirth,Takuo,"Let's go, boys. Strip her down right here."
Rebirth,Henchman 1,Are you sure?
Rebirth,Lady,No! Stop! Please! Help me!
Rebirth,Light,"Now, what will happen?"
Rebirth,Takuo,"Hey, wait up!"
Rebirth,Henchman 2,"Takuo, look out!"
Rebirth,Light,"[Gasp] That settles it. The Death Note, it's for real!"
Rebirth,Henchman 1,Oh man! Takuo!
Rebirth,Henchman 2,"Stupid kid, he just came outta nowhere! Arrgh!"
Rebirth,Ryuk,"Now then, I'd better get going."
Rebirth,Ryuk,"It's been five days. Now then, I'd better get going."
Rebirth,Deridovely,"Eh? You headed somewhere, Ryuk?"
Rebirth,Gook,"Hate to tell you, but our whole world looks like this."
Rebirth,Ryuk,"That's true, but I've dropped my Death Note."
Rebirth,Deridovely,"You really messed things up, didn't you?"
Rebirth,Gook,Hold on a sec. Didn't you already trick the Old Man to get a second book? Don't tell me you dropped both of them.
Rebirth,Deridovely,You must have some idea where you dropped the thing?
Rebirth,Ryuk,"Yeah, the human world."
Rebirth,Deridovely & Gook,What?!
Rebirth,Sachiko,What a nice surprise! I wasn't expecting you home so early.
Rebirth,Light,"Yeah. Hi mom. It's because… Huh? Oh, the results of the nationwide exams."
Rebirth,Sachiko,I've been waiting all day.
Rebirth,Light,Here.
Rebirth,Sachiko,Goodness! Number one again! These are the highest scores you've had.
Rebirth,Light,"Yeah, I guess. I'm going to study in my room so please don't interrupt me, ok?"
Rebirth,Sachiko,"As you wish. Oh Light, do you want anything at all, dear? You can ask for whatever you like."
Rebirth,Light,"No, I'm fine, Mom. Thanks though. I've already got what I want."
Rebirth,Ryuk,You've taken quite a liking to it.
Rebirth,Ryuk,"No reason to act surprised. I am the Shinigami, Ryuk. That used to be my notebook. Judging by your laughter, you've already figured out that what you have is no ordinary notebook."
Rebirth,Light,"Shinigami, a God of Death, huh? Well, I'm not surprised. In fact… Ryuk, I've been waiting for you."
Rebirth,Ryuk,Oh?
Rebirth,Light,"I've already figured out that this Death Note that I've found is real. It didn't take me long. And now that I've witnessed the proof of its power, I only feel more confident in what I'm gonna do."
Rebirth,Ryuk,"That's interesting. I certainly wasn't expecting this. Several Death Notes have made their way into the human world in the past, but you're the first to have written this many names. Look at how many people you’ve killed in only five days. Most are reluctant to write this much."
Rebirth,Light,"I've already prepared myself, Ryuk. I used the notebook even though I knew it belonged to a Shinigami, and now that Shinigami has come. So what will happen to me? You're here to take my soul, right?"
Rebirth,Ryuk,"Hmm, what do you mean? Is that some fantasy you humans came up with? I'm not gonna do anything to you. The notebook becomes part of the human realm from the very moment it touches the earth. In other words, the notebook is now yours."
Rebirth,Light,This… is mine?
Rebirth,Ryuk,"If you don't want it, just give it to someone else. But if you give it away, I'd have no choice but to erase your memories of the notebook."
Rebirth,Light,"So, then, you're saying I can use the Death Note all I want and I won't be punished?"
Rebirth,Ryuk,"Let's just say this, you will feel the fear and pain known only to humans who have used the notebook. And when it's your time to die, it will fall on me to write your name in my Death Note. Be warned, any human who's used a Death Note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity. That's all. [Laughs.] Now you have something to look forward to after you die."
Rebirth,Light,Unh!
Rebirth,Sachiko,Light?
Rebirth,Ryuk,It'll be alright. Answer it.
Rebirth,Light,What is it?
Rebirth,Sachiko,I thought you'd like some apples the neighbors brought them over for us. Why on earth is it so dark in your room? You'll ruin your eyesight.
Rebirth,Light,What's going on? Mom can't see him?
Rebirth,Ryuk,"That notebook you found originally belonged to me, and since you're now using it, you are the only one able to see me, and of course, my voice can only be heard by you. In other words, the Death Note is the bond between Light, the human and Ryuk, the Shinigami. [Bites an apple] Yum."
Rebirth,Light,"I just have one more question I wanna ask you. Why was I chosen for this? [Ryuk devours two apples] Hey, are you even listening?"
Rebirth,Ryuk,Apples in the human world are worth the trip. What's the best way to describe these? Juicy?
Rebirth,Light,Just answer my question?
Rebirth,Ryuk,"[Scoffs] I didn't choose you. Don't you see? This is all just an accident. You actually thought you were chosen because you're so smart or something? Don't be so vain. It just happened to fall around here, and you just happened to pick it up. And that's all there is to it. That's why I wrote the instructions in English, the most popular language in the human world."
Rebirth,Light,"Then why did you drop it in the first place? You even wrote down specific instructions, so don't try telling me this was an accident!"
Rebirth,Ryuk,You're asking me why? I did it 'cause I was bored.
Rebirth,Light,You were bored?
Rebirth,Ryuk,"The truth is Shinigami haven't got much to do these days. Most of the time we're either taking naps or gambling. If you take the time to write names in your Death Note, the others just laugh at you for working so hard. Even if you wrote the name of another Shinigami, it'd be pointless because they wouldn't die. And since we live in the Shinigami Realm, it brings us no amusement to kill those in the human world either. So I figured I'd have more fun if I came down here myself. Anyway, I'm surprised at how many names you've written, but I wanna know why you only wrote the cause of death for that guy who was hit by the truck."
Rebirth,Light,"If you don't write down the cause of death, the victim dies of a heart attack, and that's probably the best thing about the Death Note, Ryuk. You see, I've already exhausted the list of the world's major criminals, and eventually, I'm going to get rid of them all."
Rebirth,Ryuk,What's the point of doing that?
Rebirth,Light,It's only a matter of time before people figure out that these criminals are being eliminated by someone. I want the world to know of my existence. That there's someone passing righteous judgement on the wicked!
Rebirth,Ryuk,"Why even bother? What are you trying to achieve by passing judgement on them. I mean, why do you care?"
Rebirth,Light,"Because… I've been bored too. I wasn't ready to believe it at first, but it's obvious now. There's something about the Death Note itself that makes humans want to try it out at least once."
Rebirth,Light,"I killed them both. I really… I killed to men. Those were human lives, it won't be overlooked. Besides, who am I to pass judgement on others? Uhh… no, no wait. Maybe I'm wrong. This is exactly what I've been thinking about lately. This world is rotting, and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world can't go on like this."
Rebirth,Light,"I've wondered… what if someone else picked up this notebook. Is there anyone out there, other than me, who would be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it; there's no one, but I can do it. In fact, I'm the only one who can. I'll do it, using the Death Note, I'll change the world."
Rebirth,Light,"At first, I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of. Like I was cleaning up the world, one name at a time, so that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again. And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks, the people who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death. Then and only then the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world, free of injustice, and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking."
Rebirth,Ryuk,"But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left."
Rebirth,Light,Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a hard working honor student considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest. And I… I will become the God of this New World.
Rebirth,Ryuk,"It's just as I thought, humans are so interesting."
Rebirth,Light,[Laughs] I'll show the world what happens when you try to cross me. The entire world is watching now… L.
Confrontation,Light,The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die…
Confrontation,Takuo,[Laughs] Woo!
Confrontation,Lady,Help me!
Confrontation,Light,Now… what will happen?
Confrontation,Light,"The Death Note, it's for real!"
Confrontation,Ryuk,Any human who's used a Death Note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity.
Confrontation,Light,I want the world to know of my existence. That there's someone passing righteous judgement on the wicked! And I… I will become the God of this New World!
Confrontation,English teacher,"He found himself overwhelmed with happiness and satisfaction, [Girl talking: I have no idea what he was thinking coming to my house, but I am so through with him.] [Boy: Seriously? So what happened with your dad after that?] knowing that, at long last, his dream had finally come true. Alright then. Yagami? Please recite this line for us."
Confrontation,Light,"Sure. Having finally made his dream a reality, he was overwhelmed. Both by the magnitude of his achievement, and by the joy and happiness that it brought him."
Confrontation,,Light sits back down.
Confrontation,English teacher,"That was very well done, but I'm not surprised, of course. Absolutely flawless. Very good. Well then, we'll leave it at that for today."
Confrontation,,The students groan and get up from their seats. The bell rings.
Confrontation,Ryuk,"[Outside] I thought it'd never end. How do you do this every day? It's so boring here. Hey, where're you going? Hey, Light! Are you listening to me?"
Confrontation,Light,"[Quietly] Don't talk to me. Unlike you, people can still hear me when I talk out loud."
Confrontation,Ryuk,"Heh, well aren't you boring."
Confrontation,Young man,"Hey, what's up, Light? We were just going to head down to the—"
Confrontation,Light,"Sorry, I'm a little busy today."
Confrontation,Ryuk,"You don't have anything to do. Aren't you just going to go home and hang out in your room, as usual?"
Confrontation,Light,"What are you talking about? Of course I have something to do. Yes, something very important."
Confrontation,,Scene change. A news broadcast is playing on the TV in Light's bedroom. Light is writing names down in his Death Note.
Confrontation,News Reporter,"There was more violence across the city today. Another stabbing, this time at a restaurant in the heart of the Kabuki-cho district of Shinjuku."
Confrontation,,"Ryuk sits on Light's bed, munching on an apple."
Confrontation,Ryuk,"[Bites an apple] Mmm. Hey, Light. [Swallows] I'm talking to you."
Confrontation,Light,What is it?
Confrontation,Ryuk,Why are you working so hard?
Confrontation,Light,"I can't afford to waste any time. I have a very small window to write names in this notebook. I only have from when I get home from school until I go to bed. I still need to sleep so I can maintain my average and stay at the top of my class. Obviously, I can't be sleeping in class. Plus, there's all the studying at home and at cram school. I can't let myself get too tired. It will start to affect my health and my mental performance. If I'm serious about trying to create an ideal world that's free from evil then I need to make the most of my time."
Confrontation,,The door knob turns then clicks as it stops.
Confrontation,Sayu,"Huh? Weird. Hey, Light, what's going on? Why is your door locked?"
Confrontation,Light,It's Sayu. What is it?
Confrontation,Sayu,Can you help me with my homework?
Confrontation,Light,"Uh, yeah. Okay."
Confrontation,,Light puts the Death Note in his desk drawer and goes to open the door.
Confrontation,Sayu,"We're doing quadratic equations in math. Sorry to interrupt. I know you're studying right now, but I'm like the only person in my class who doesn't get this stuff. Thanks so much!"
Confrontation,Light,No problem.
Confrontation,Ryuk,"I'd be careful if I were you. If anyone else touches that notebook you've got hidden in the drawer right now, they'll be able to see me too."
Confrontation,Light,"[Thinking] Huh, he waits till now to mention that important detail?! Damn Shinigami."
Confrontation,Sayu,What's wrong? Are you alright?
Confrontation,Light,Hm? It's nothing. So what exactly don't you understand? What are you stuck on?
Confrontation,Sayu,Um…well…I think all of it.
Confrontation,,Scene change to ICPO headquarters.
Confrontation,Delegate 1,"There have been fifty-two deaths that we're aware of, and that's just in the past week."
Confrontation,Delegate 2,Every single one of them involved a heart attack.
Confrontation,Delegate 1,They were all criminals who were either being held in prison or who were wanted by police for outstanding crimes. And I think it's safe to say there are other criminals whose deaths are unaccounted for.
Confrontation,Delegate 3,In which case the death toll could be well over 100.
Confrontation,Matsuda,"Uh… morning, Chief. They started the meeting without you."
Confrontation,Soichiro,That's fine. I had to take an urgent call from headquarters.
Confrontation,Delegate 2,"At any rate, these were criminals who were probably facing execution sooner or later. Perhaps we shouldn't be—"
Confrontation,Delegate 1,"Why should it matter if it's a criminal or someone innocent?! Last time I checked, murder was still murder!"
Confrontation,Delegate 3,It's still too early to consider these a homicide.
Confrontation,Delegate 1,"Then how did all these people have heart attacks at the exact same time?! That's not coincidence, it's murder!"
Confrontation,Delegate 3,You think it's possible to simultaneously kill all these people in different locations?
Confrontation,Delegate 4,We're treating this as an elaborate murder plot that's been carried out by a large organization.
Confrontation,Delegate 5,"If it is a large organization, I'm sure I'm not alone in suspecting the FBI or CIA."
Confrontation,Delegate 6,[Off-screen] I dare you to say that again!
Confrontation,Delegate 7,"Now, now, this is not the time to be joking around! We need to confirm that these are indeed homicides and not coincidences!"
Confrontation,Delegate 3,"How? Autopsy results show that in all of these cases, the victims died of a sudden heart attack."
Confrontation,Delegate 4,Investigating a series of heart attacks is pointless. I don't see what else we can learn.
Confrontation,Delegate 5,"Absolutely. If these people had been shot or stabbed, at least we'd have something to go on."
Confrontation,Delegate 1,"If that's the case, it looks as if we'll have no choice but to bring in L."
Confrontation,,The room quiets down and people begin murmuring amongst themselves.
Confrontation,Matsuda,"Uh, Chief. What's this ""L"" they're talking about?"
Confrontation,Soichiro,"Right, I forgot that it's your first time at this conference. We don't know L's real name or whereabouts. In fact, we still don't even know what he looks like. However, he's managed to solve every case he's ever taken on. And he's tackled some of the greatest mysteries this world has even known. He hides in the shadows, but he's the best of the best. A last resort. Our trump card."
Confrontation,Delegate 8,"But I've heard this ""L"" is extremely arrogant and has tended to only take on cases that he's personally interested in."
Confrontation,Delegate 9,"That's exactly right! Besides, we don't even know how to contact him!"
Confrontation,Watari,L is already on the move.
Confrontation,,"The room goes quiet as Watari enters, hidden in a black trench coat and hat."
Confrontation,Watari,"Gentlemen, L has already begun his investigation into these incidents."
Confrontation,Matsuda,Huh? Who's that?
Confrontation,Soichiro,That man's the only known person who can contact L. Nobody knows his true identity either.
Confrontation,Watari,Please be silent. L would now like to address the delegates.
Confrontation,,Watari opens a laptop.
Confrontation,L (voice altered via voice distorter),Greetings to all of you at the ICPO. I…am L.
Confrontation,,Scene change. The camera pans across the outside of a run-down building.
Confrontation,Ryuk,[Inside] What are we doing here anyway? I don't understand why we're sneaking around this dump. Tell me.
Confrontation,Light,"Isn't it obvious? Anyone who touches the Death Note will be able to see you. I can't afford to carry something this dangerous with me anymore. Up until now, I thought that if my family ever saw the notebook, I can tell them I was keeping records of various criminals in preparation for becoming a detective one day. But I'm walking a very fine line right now. I don't want to think about it, but if I make one mistake, I might end up killing my own family."
Confrontation,,Light mixes two liquids which then ignite. Scene change back to ICPO headquarters.
Confrontation,L,"The difficulty of this case lies on its unprecedented scope. And make no mistake. We are witnessing an atrocious act of mass murder, one that is unforgivable. This case cannot be solved without the full cooperation of the ICPO. That is all of the police organizations you represent throughout the world. You need to make the decision to fully support the investigation at this meeting. Also, I require additional cooperation from Japan's National Police Agency."
Confrontation,Soichiro,Huh? What? Why Japan in particular?
Confrontation,L,"Whether the guilty party is an individual or a group, there's a strong possibility that they are Japanese. And even if they are not, we can be sure they're hiding in Japan."
Confrontation,Soichiro,What is all this based on?
Confrontation,L,"Why Japan, you ask? I think I will be able to provide you with proof of that after I directly confront the culprit."
Confrontation,Soichiro,A direct confrontation?
Confrontation,L,"At any rate, I would like to set up the investigation headquarters in Japan."
Confrontation,,Scene change. Light's room. Light relaxes into his desk chair.
Confrontation,Light,That was easier to make than I thought it'd be.
Confrontation,Ryuk,Huh? Does that mean you were able to hide the notebook?
Confrontation,Light,Yeah. I hid it right here in this drawer.
Confrontation,Ryuk,But it doesn't seem to be particularly well hidden. You left the key in the lock.
Confrontation,Light,And that's the whole point. I intentionally left the key in the most noticeable place I could think of.
Confrontation,,"Light opens the drawer, revealing a brown leather diary."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Isn't that just a regular diary?
Confrontation,Light,"That's what it is. I'm guessing that once most people find the diary inside my desk, that'll probably satisfy their curiosity. But the real key is this. Just an everyday item you'd expect to find lying around on my desk. A regular ball-point pen, and all I need is this part."
Confrontation,,He removes the ink reservoir of the pen.
Confrontation,Ryuk,So that's the key?
Confrontation,Light,"Yeah. If you look closely, you'll find there's a small hole underneath the drawer. Then you just insert this."
Confrontation,,"Light inserts the ink filler into the hole. It lifts up the bottom of the drawer, revealing the Death Note in the real drawer."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Aha. A fake bottom. The diary will distract most people so I doubt anyone will find it.
Confrontation,Light,But that's not all.
Confrontation,Ryuk,Oh?
Confrontation,Light,"Even if someone figures out there's a fake base, I've set things up so that there's no way they could get their hands on the notebook. You see, once the ink reservoir is inserted, it accesses an insulator, preventing the flow of electricity around this circuit. When the fake base of the drawer's put back, this piece of rubber also prevents the flow of electricity. However, if someone were to try and force the bottom of the drawer open, the circuit would connect and now would ignite the gasoline contained in this thin plastic casing, instantly setting the notebook on fire. The way I’ve got it set up, all the evidence will be completely destroyed. If I'm ever questioned, I'd say that I was hiding the real diary because I didn't want anyone to see it. It sounds like a pretty believable excuse. I mean, it is my diary after all."
Confrontation,Ryuk,"I've heard of humans finding Death Notes in the past and typically the biggest problem they had was finding a good place to hide it. But you, Light, you're probably the first to have given it this much thought. Though, it's a pretty risky setup from the look of it. If you make even the slightest mistake, you could be badly burned."
Confrontation,Light,"Risky? You say the strangest thing sometimes, Ryuk. This whole thing has been a risk since the very beginning, from the moment I obtained the Death Note. I'm sorry, but compared to that, this doesn't even qualify as a risk to me. In fact, it actually protects me. It all comes down to a choice: would I prefer to be executed or deal with a little house fire?"
Confrontation,,Commercial break
Confrontation,,Scene change to Daikoku Private Academy.
Confrontation,Announcer,"Last night in the West Tokyo penitentiary, Naoki Koro Kitayama, originally sentenced to fifteen years for armed robbery, was reported to have died of a sudden heart attack at the age of thirty-two. This is just the most recent death in the steadily growing number of cases involving inmates dying of heart attacks."
Confrontation,Student 1,This is unbelievable. Criminals are dropping like flies lately.
Confrontation,Student 2,"It's a little scary, but at the same time, it's kind of cool."
Confrontation,Student 1,Sure. Just make sure you don't do anything bad.
Confrontation,Student 3,I won't be surprised if the police were behind this.
Confrontation,Student 2,No way. The police don't have that kind of power.
Confrontation,Student 1,Don't you know about him?
Confrontation,Student 3,Huh? About who?
Confrontation,Student 1,"Kira. You know, Kira."
Confrontation,Student 4,I wonder who's gonna be killed next.
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room. Light looks at his computer.
Confrontation,Light,"Ryuk, you should check this out."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Huh?
Confrontation,,Ryuk moves to stand behind Light.
Confrontation,Light,Websites like this are popping up everywhere lately.
Confrontation,Ryuk,The Legend of Kira the Savior. Huh. Sounds pretty cool. Is this about you?
Confrontation,Light,"Yeah. I think they've taken the name ""Kira"" from the English word ""killer."" Can't say I'm too happy about that, but it looks like that's the name they've decided to give me. When I search the word Kira, I'm pulling up tons of sites just like this one. The media hasn't picked up on it. They're still calling this a succession of unexplained deaths among the world's most hardened criminals. But…the people of the world can already sense that there's something happening. They know there's someone out there passing righteous judgment."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Oh?
Confrontation,Light,"Human beings are like that, Ryuk."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Huh.
Confrontation,Light,"Although this would probably never happen in school, let's say that students were asked to discuss whether bad people deserve to die. Well, you can bet that everyone will give the politically correct answer."
Confrontation,,Scene change to Daikoku Private Academy.
Confrontation,Girl,It's just wrong to kill people.
Confrontation,,Scene change. Back to Light's room.
Confrontation,Light,"That's what they are bound to say. Of course, that's the correct response to give, right? Humans are always trying to maintain appearances when they're in public. That's just how we are. But this is how they really feel. Most are too afraid to support me as they're worried about what others would think. Many would rather deny my existence. But on the Internet, where you can remain anonymous, support for Kira is growing. Maybe people are afraid to say it out loud, but they all understand what's happening. Someone's making the bad guys disappear one by one. Those who have done no wrong are cheering for Kira in their hearts because they have nothing to fear, while those who have done wrong are on the run. They are forced to hide from an unknown enemy. This is how it should be. It's perfect. Everything is going just like I planned."
Confrontation,,Time change. Later that afternoon in Light's room.
Confrontation,TV Announcer,"We'd like to apologize for the interruption. As of now, we're bringing you a live worldwide broadcast from Interpol, ICPO."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Hm? What's this?
Confrontation,Light,Interpol?
Confrontation,TV Announcer,We now take you live to the ICPO.
Confrontation,Lind L. Tailor,"I head up an International Police Task Force which includes all member nations. I am Lind L. Tailor, otherwise known as L."
Confrontation,Light,Huh? Who is this guy?
Confrontation,,Scene change to the Japan National Police Agency headquarters.
Confrontation,Soichiro,So this is how it all begins.
Confrontation,Matsuda,"But, sir, I don't get it. He's never actually shown his face before, right? Why would he choose to do it now?"
Confrontation,Soichiro,It must mean L's serious about this.
Confrontation,Matsuda,Hm.
Confrontation,Soichiro,"[Thinking] L, we've followed every single one of your orders. Now, it's time for you to prove what you said to the ICPO."
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,Lind L. Tailor (on television screen),"Criminals around the world are being murdered by a serial killer. I consider this crime to be the most atrocious act of murder in history. I will not rest until the person or persons responsible are brought to justice. Kira, I will hunt you down. I will find you."
Confrontation,Ryuk,He seems certain he'll catch you.
Confrontation,Light,"Hm. That fool. He'll never find me. [Picks up the Death Note and stands] He'll have to get this first. And as long as the police don't find it, there won't be any evidence to convict me, which means catching me will be absolutely impossible. [Relaxes in his chair] I anticipated that the police would get involved and that something like this might happen."
Confrontation,Lind L. Tailor,"Kira, I've got a pretty good idea what your motivation might be, and I can guess what you hope to achieve. However, what you're doing right now is evil."
Confrontation,,Light gasps and stands up.
Confrontation,Light,"You think…I'm evil? I am justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil! I'm the one who will become the god of a new world that everyone desires! All those who oppose that god, they are the ones who are truly evil!"
Confrontation,,Light opens the Death Note and readies a pen. He looks back up at the television.
Confrontation,Light,"I guess you're just too stupid, L. Too bad. This could've been a lot more interesting if you'd only been a bit smarter."
Confrontation,,Light writes Lind L. Tailor's name in large letters and laughs maniacally. He looks back at the screen.
Confrontation,Light,I'll show the world what happens when you cross me. The entire world is watching…L.
Confrontation,,Light glances at his watch.
Confrontation,Light,Five more seconds.
Confrontation,,The second hand on the watch ticks audibly as Light counts down. The camera changes between the two scenes.
Confrontation,Light,Four…three…two…one…
Confrontation,,"Lind L. Tailor collapses, dead. Light gasps then laughs maniacally."
Confrontation,Light,What's wrong? You've got nothing else to say?
Confrontation,,"Two suited men with black sunglasses remove Lind L. Tailor's body from view as Light continues to laugh. L's symbol suddenly flashes on screen, silencing Light."
Confrontation,L (through voice modifier),"Ah. I had to test this, just in case, but I-I never thought it would actually happen. Kira…it seems you can kill people without having to be there in person. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't just witnessed it. Listen to me, Kira. If you did, indeed, kill Lind L. Tailor, the man who you just saw die on television, I should tell you that he was an inmate whose execution was scheduled for today. That was not me."
Confrontation,Light,What?
Confrontation,L,"The police arrested him in absolute secrecy, so you wouldn't have heard of him on TV or through the internet. It appears not even you have access to information about these types of criminals."
Confrontation,,Ryuk laughs and looks at Light.
Confrontation,Ryuk,He got you there.
Confrontation,,The scene changes between L's symbol and the hidden face of a man speaking into a microphone.
Confrontation,L,"But I assure you, L is real. I do exist. Now…try to kill me!"
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,Light,You…you bastard!
Confrontation,,Scene change to Japan National Police Agency headquarters. L still challenging Kira.
Confrontation,L,"What's wrong? Go ahead! Come on, right now! Kill me!"
Confrontation,Officer 1,What the hell is going on? L is taking this too far.
Confrontation,Officer 2,"Are you trying to kill yourself, L?!"
Confrontation,,"Scene change to the city center. People have gathered around large screen, listening to L's challenge."
Confrontation,Bystander 1,What's going on?
Confrontation,Bystander 2,"Look, it's Kira versus L!"
Confrontation,Bystander 3,Huh? What?
Confrontation,,The crowd begins to murmur.
Confrontation,Bystander 4,This is freaky.
Confrontation,Bystander 5,Amazing.
Confrontation,Bystander 6,"Do it, Kira!"
Confrontation,Bystander 7,"Someone, stop this!"
Confrontation,Bystander 8,What's the matter?!
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,L,Can't you do it?
Confrontation,,Light stares at the TV incredulously.
Confrontation,L,"Well Kira, it seems you can't kill me after all."
Confrontation,,"Ryuk laughs once again. Scene change to the man with the microphone, L."
Confrontation,L,So there are some people you can't kill. You've given me a useful hint.
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,L,"Let me return the favor. I'll tell you something that I think you'll find interesting. Although this was announced as a worldwide broadcast, the truth is, we are only broadcasting in the Kanto region of Japan. I had planned to broadcast this message around the world until we found you, but it looks like that won't be necessary. I know now where you are."
Confrontation,Ryuk,[Laughs] This L guy is pretty good.
Confrontation,L,"The police treated your first killing as an unrelated incident, but in actuality, the first of your victims was a suspect in Shinjuku."
Confrontation,,Flashback to the scene of the incident.
Confrontation,L,"Of all the criminals that recently died of heart attacks, this one's crime was, by far, the least serious. Furthermore, his crime was only ever reported inside Japan."
Confrontation,,Present day. Scene change to L's location.
Confrontation,L,"I used that information to deduce this much. You are in Japan and your first victim was little more than an experiment, which means you haven't been killing for very long."
Confrontation,,Light gasps. Scene change to the city center.
Confrontation,L,"We decided to broadcast in Kanto first because of its large population, and, luckily, we found you."
Confrontation,,Scene change to Japan National Police Agency headquarters.
Confrontation,L,"To be completely honest with you, I never expected that things would go this well, but…it won't be too long now before I am able to sentence you to death."
Confrontation,Matsuda,L has…certainly lived up to his reputation.
Confrontation,Soichiro,"Mmhmm. He proved that Kira exists, that the deaths were murders, and that he is here in Japan."
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,L,"Naturally, I am very interested to know how you're able to commit these murders without being present…but I don't mind waiting a little bit longer. [Scene change to L's location.] You can answer all of my questions when I catch you… Let's meet again soon, Kira."
Confrontation,,"Scene change to Light's room. The broadcast cuts out and leaves the screen snowy, a fuzzy sound filling the quiet room."
Confrontation,Light,"Really? He's gonna sentence me to death? Sounds interesting. I accept your challenge, L."
Confrontation,Ryuk,[Thinking] Each of them has to hunt down the other without knowing the other's name or face. And the first one whose identity is revealed will die. Humans are so much fun.
Confrontation,,The scene constantly changes between Light's room and L's location.
Confrontation,Light,L…
Confrontation,L,Kira…
Confrontation,,Split screen.
Confrontation,Both Light and L,I will hunt you down wherever you're hiding and I will eliminate you!
Confrontation,Light,I am…
Confrontation,L,I am…
Confrontation,Both,Justice!
Confrontation,Light,"I'm not the one who's going to find L. I can let the police do that for me. And when they do, that's when I'll eliminate him! Looks like I may be able to provide you with more entertainment, Ryuk."
Dealings,L,"Greetings to all of you at the ICPO. I…am L. Whether the guilty party is an individual or a group, there's a strong possibility that they are Japanese."
Dealings,Lind L. Tailor,"Kira, I've got a pretty good idea what your motivation might be, and I can guess what you hope to achieve. However, what you're doing right now is evil."
Dealings,Light,You…you bastard.
Dealings,L,Now…try to kill me!
Dealings,Light,I am justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil! I'm the one who will become the god of a new world that everyone desires!
Dealings,Officer 1 (talking over Light),What the hell is going on? L is taking this too far.
Dealings,L (talking over Light),"Go ahead! Come on, right now! Kill me!"
Dealings,Light,L…
Dealings,L,Kira…
Dealings,,Split screen
Dealings,Both Light and L,"I will hunt you down wherever you're hiding, and I will eliminate you!"
Dealings,Light,I am…
Dealings,L,I am…
Dealings,Both,Justice!
Dealings,,Task Force headquarters
Dealings,Soichiro,All right. Let's start with the tip line reports.
Dealings,Mogi,"Yes, sir. Up to this point, we've received three thousand twenty-nine responses about the murders via telephone and e-mail. Most of these have been curious citizens and prank calls, but there are fourteen people who claimed to either know Kira or who have seen him. All fourteen accounts were followed up on and carefully documented. However, nobody could provide any information that wasn't already publicly available. And lastly, this week there were additional twenty-one people who called in claiming to be Kira."
Dealings,Soichiro,Huh. [Clears throat]
Dealings,Mogi,We didn't wanna rule anything out. So we followed standard procedure and created files for all twenty-one of them.
Dealings,Soichiro,Uh huh. All right. On to the victim reports.
Dealings,Officer 2,"Yes, sir. Upon further investigation, we have confirmed that information of the heart attack victims was in fact publicly available in Japan immediately prior to their deaths. Also, concerning L's request that we investigate the time of death for each victim, we found that all of them occurred between the hours of 4 p.m. and 2 a.m. on weekdays, local time, with sixty-eight percent of them occurring between 8 p.m. and 12 a.m. Weekends and holidays appeared to be the exception to this rule as the times of deaths vary much more widely than during the week."
Dealings,L,"[Through voice modifier] That information is extremely relevant for us. It suggests that, given the times of death, our suspect could very well be a student."
Dealings,Soichiro,Hmm?
Dealings,L,"Based on the fact that Kira is only killing criminals, I think it's safe to assume that he is driven by a very idealistic notion of justice. It's highly possible he may even aspire to be some sort of godlike figure. We're dealing with the individual who has a very childish concept of right and wrong. Of course, this is mere speculation at this point, but still, I recommend you re-examine any assumptions you've made as to whether or not our suspect could be a student. We must consider every possibility. I believe that's the shortest route to finding and arresting Kira. Please, continue with your report."
Dealings,Soichiro,Hm. Oh right. Does anyone else have something they'd like to add?
Dealings,Matsuda,"Um, yes sir."
Dealings,Soichiro,"What is it, Matsuda?"
Dealings,Matsuda,"Um…well I'm not saying this to support Kira or to condone the murders, but…in the last few days throughout the world, but especially here in Japan, we've observed the dramatic decrease in the number of violent crimes committed."
Dealings,Soichiro,"Well, I suppose it makes sense. We've suspected something like that would happen. Anything else?"
Dealings,Matsuda,No.
Dealings,Soichiro,"Well, that about sums up our report for today. L?"
Dealings,L,"Thank you, everyone. I feel we're one step closer to finding Kira. Before I go, I'm afraid I have one additional request to make. This is directed to the teams investigating the victims, TV news, and internet: I would like you to go back and take a closer look at the exact way in which the victims' identities were made public. Be as thorough as possible. In particular, I want to know if photos of the victims were made available to the public in Japan. I'll leave it to you."
Dealings,Soichiro,[Stretching] Ah… ah…
Dealings,Matsuda,Chief!
Dealings,Soichiro,Hm?
Dealings,Matsuda,You look like you could use one of these. Sleeping much?
Dealings,Soichiro,Ah. Thank you. That'll do the trick. I feel all these late nights are starting to take their toll. [Sips coffee] Ah.
Dealings,Matsuda,"About what I said earlier at our meeting…well, now that I think about it, um, I'm sure everyone already knew that. I wanted to apologize."
Dealings,Soichiro,"What on earth are you talking about? Nobody said it'll be easy to speak the truth, but it has to be done. Especially when it is something that isn't easy to say."
Dealings,Matsuda,Ha?
Dealings,Soichiro,"Having said that, if you had gone on to say that we should commend Kira for doing such a great job of reducing violent crime, then yes, I might have had a little problem with that."
Dealings,Matsuda,"Oh, no. No, I wouldn't. That would never happen!"
Dealings,Soichiro,[Laughs] Just kidding.
Dealings,,"Yagami household, in Light's bedroom"
Dealings,Sayu,"I knew I can count on you, Light."
Dealings,Light,"Hey, so do you think you're ready to try a few on your own now?"
Dealings,Sayu,"Huh? Yeah. I guess so. Oh, sounds like Dad's home."
Dealings,,Downstairs
Dealings,Sachiko,"Welcome home, dear."
Dealings,Soichiro,Thank you.
Dealings,,Back in Light's room
Dealings,Sayu,He's home really early today.
Dealings,Light,"Hey, why don't you at least try the last problem by yourself?"
Dealings,Sayu,"I will, but maybe after dinner."
Dealings,,Sayu exits.
Dealings,Light,"Yeah, right."
Dealings,Ryuk,"Helping your sister with her homework, you sure are relaxed."
Dealings,Light,"Of course. If the police try to come after me, I'm pretty confident I've got something that'll give me the advantage."
Dealings,,Downstairs in the dining room
Dealings,Light,"Hey, glad you can join us for dinner. You hungry, Dad?"
Dealings,Soichiro,Yeah. It's been a long day.
Dealings,,Scene change to Light's family eating dinner as Ryuk watches
Dealings,Soichiro,"So, Light, tell me. How are your studies going?"
Dealings,Light,"Hm? Everything's okay, I guess."
Dealings,Sayu,Whatever. He's at the top of his class. My big brother is a genius!
Dealings,Sachiko,"That's my son! We're all proud of you, Light."
Dealings,Light,"Is everything okay, Dad? You look tired."
Dealings,Soichiro,"Yeah. I'm not able to say too much about it, but this case I'm working on now is really tough."
Dealings,,Light's room
Dealings,Ryuk,"[Thinks] I see. Well, well. Daddy's a policeman. And that must be the reason why you're so confident?"
Dealings,Light,"That's right. It's easy for me to hack into Dad's computer. We're on a home network, so I can copy the files I need without leaving a trace. This way, I can keep track of their investigation. Here we go. Well, isn't that interesting? Looks like the police are already beginning to suspect a student."
Dealings,Ryuk,[Laughs] I guess that means you are in trouble.
Dealings,Light,"If the cause of death is written within forty seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next six minutes and forty seconds. That sound right to you, Ryuk?"
Dealings,Ryuk,So what's your point?
Dealings,Light,"In other words, if I write heart attacks as the cause of death, then I should be able to write down all the details including time of death afterward, shouldn't I? Looks like I will be able to provide you with more entertainment now."
Dealings,,"Scene changes to Light walking outside and then changes to a prison. An inmate is grunting and sticks his hand out of his cell, then dies. Light is then shown playing a soccer match, but it soon changes to another prison where several inmates are lined up."
Dealings,Inmate,[Grunts]
Dealings,Officer,"Inmate 148, what's wrong? Snap out of it!"
Dealings,,Scene changes to Light taking his food out of a bad and opening his lunch while it cuts to another inmate ripping his shirt and gasping for air as he dies in the prison cafeteria.
Dealings,,Task Force headquarters
Dealings,Soichiro,What? I-I don't believe this. Another twenty-three victims yesterday? Are these confirmed?
Dealings,Officer 1,Yes.
Dealings,Soichiro,"The day before there were another twenty-three victims. He's killing one off, every hour on the hour."
Dealings,Officer 2,Considering that this new pattern has been going on for two weekdays…
Dealings,Officer 1,It does punch some holes in the theory that our suspect is a student.
Dealings,Officer 3,Maybe not. Anybody can skip two days of school.
Dealings,L,[Through voice modifier] You're missing the point.
Dealings,Soichiro,Huh?
Dealings,Task Force members,Huh?
Dealings,L,"It does appear less likely now that Kira is a student, but that's not the message he's sending by doing this."
Dealings,Matsuda,Ah!
Dealings,L,"Ask yourselves, why every hour? And why are all these victims in prisons where they should be discovered immediately? Why not other criminals like before? I believe Kira is telling us that not only can he kill from a distance, but he can also determine the time of death. But something's not right. As soon as we began to suspect that Kira might be a student, the pacing of the killings changed. As if to contradict that theory. Coincidence? No. Too convenient. This can only mean that Kira has access to police information. It's obvious now. This is a direct challenge to me."
Dealings,,Light's room
Dealings,Light,I'd say L is probably starting to sweat a little by now. What'll really make his job difficult is that I've deliberately left about fifty criminals alive for times like this.
Dealings,Ryuk,Oh?
Dealings,Light,"If L is as good as they say, by now, he should be starting to suspect someone with connections to the police."
Dealings,,Unknown location
Dealings,L,So Kira has found a way to obtain information from the Task Force headquarters. This is one fact that cannot be ignored. But what does he get out of all this? What is he hoping to achieve in the end?
Dealings,,Light's room
Dealings,Ryuk,There's one thing I don't get. Showing them you have connections to the police makes it easier for them to find you than when they just suspected you a student.
Dealings,Light,"Well, my real agenda is…to get close to L, so I can eliminate him."
Dealings,Ryuk,How are you gonna do that?
Dealings,Light,"You still don't understand human beings. In this world, there are very few people who actually trust each other. And it's no different for the police, you know. What's especially important is that L and the investigators don't trust each other at all. Think about it. Could you trust someone whose name and face you don't even know? When L discovers that I'm somehow getting confidential information, he'll be obligated to start investigating the police to find the source of the leak. When that happens, it'll only be a matter of time before the police start resenting L. On the surface, it will appear that L and the investigation team are working together to try to catch me. But in reality, L will investigate the police, and they will be investigating L. I'm not the one who is going to find L. I can let the police do that for me. And when they do, that's when I'll eliminate him."
Dealings,,Commercial break
Dealings,,Task Force headquarters
Dealings,Soichiro,What's this about?
Dealings,Officer 1,"With all due respect, Chief, we are resigning."
Dealings,Officer 2,"We demand that you assign us to a different case. Otherwise, you can have our badges right here and now."
Dealings,Soichiro,Why? You're good cops!
Dealings,Officer 1,"Isn't it clear? It's because we value our lives, sir."
Dealings,Officer 2,"If what L says is true, Kira has some ESP-like power that somehow allows him to kill people indirectly from anywhere."
Dealings,Officer 3,"Well, if I were Kira, sir, I'd probably wanna trying to get rid of the people who are trying to catch me."
Dealings,Officer 2,"Let's face it, he knows he will be sentenced to death if he's caught."
Dealings,Officer 1,"We all sat here and watched when L decided to pull that media stunt and challenge Kira to kill him. Well, it was all very impressive at the time, but then again, L never had to show his face or reveal his name for that matter. I'm sure you recall L's last request? He asked that we take a closer look at how these victims' identities were made public and specifically to determine whether photos of the victims were available to the public prior to their deaths. Well, it turns out he was right! Every single one of those victims' names and photos were broadcast to the Japanese public, and then they died! Unlike someone we know, we are out there investigating this case wearing police IDs with our names and photos on them! Anybody with a computer can find out who we are! We don't hide our faces! We're out in the open!"
Dealings,Officer 3,"Sir, the truth is, we could be killed by Kira at any time."
Dealings,Officer 1,"For these reasons, we refuse to continue working this case. Excuse us, Chief."
Dealings,Soichiro,"Hey, stop! All of you, hold it right there!"
Dealings,,"Scene change to L watching his computer screen, then Ryuk with Light in Daikoku Private Academy"
Dealings,Ryuk,Huh?
Dealings,Math professor,"In order to solve this problem, we must establish the concept that X squared equals large X. Now pay attention because this is important. Before we tackle more complex quadratic equations, we have to start thinking of large X's value as simply the multiple of two integers. Now let's apply this concept to our first problem."
Dealings,,Unknown location
Dealings,Watari,"We brought the FBI to Japan four days ago. They are fully operational. As requested, they're now gathering intel on the police."
Dealings,L,And this is the complete list?
Dealings,Watari,Yes.
Dealings,L,"[Thinking] There are one hundred forty-one people in the police force who have access to classified information regarding the investigation. I am sure that somewhere in this list of the police officers and the people closest to them, we will find our suspect."
Dealings,,"Streets, Light is walking and Ryuk is hovering beside him"
Dealings,Ryuk,"Light, you got a second?"
Dealings,Light,"I've already told you, Ryuk. You can't talk to me in public. How many times do I have to tell you?"
Dealings,Ryuk,"In that case, I'll talk, you just listen. If you don't want to hear me, you can plug your ears or something. First of all, I don't have anything against you. I actually think the notebook couldn't have been picked up by a better person. I'm here 'cause I have to stick around till the Death Note is finished or I see you die, whichever comes first. But make no mistake, Light, I'm not on your side or L's side."
Dealings,Light,"Yeah. Well, I knew that much already."
Dealings,Ryuk,"You'll never hear me say anything about whether what you're doing is right or wrong. I'm not here to support you or give you my opinion. I'm just a spectator, but as your roommate, I might have a few things to say now and then."
Dealings,Light,"What's this about, Ryuk? Why are you telling me all this stuff now, anyway? It's really not like you."
Dealings,Ryuk,"It's just that I'm no ally of yours, or Kira's, if you prefer. The only reason I'm going to tell you this is because, personally, it is starting to creep me out."
Dealings,Light,Get to the point already.
Dealings,Ryuk,"[Laughs] You are being followed by another human. He's watching you right now. It's really starting to get on my nerves. I realize there's no way he can see me, but, because I'm always following behind you wherever you go, I feel like I'm constantly being watched."
Dealings,Light,That's a problem. I'll have to get rid of him as soon as possible.
Dealings,,Light's room
Dealings,Light,"[Thinking] Who would be following me? Does this mean L is already starting to suspect the police? If he's gonna investigate the police, he'll need a lot of resources and manpower. Even if he has as many as fifty people on the case, I don't see how they could ever figure out that I'm Kira. I shouldn't look like anything other than your average high school senior. But the longer I let this person keep following me, the greater the chance is they'll figure out who I really am. Above all, I need my stalker's name. Once I figure that out, I can get rid of him for good."
Dealings,Ryuk,"Light, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. What makes a Shinigami and a human who has a Death Note different? Well, there are two things. And why do Shinigami have to write the names of humans in their Death Notes? You got any ideas?"
Dealings,Light,"Of course not. Why would I know that? You know, you sure are talkative today."
Dealings,Ryuk,It's because we are able to take human lifespans for ourselves.
Dealings,Light,"Huh? Wait, what do you mean by that?"
Dealings,Ryuk,Let's say you have a human who is due to live until the age of sixty and a God of Death wrote that this person would die at forty. Sixty minus forty equals twenty. Now those twenty years taken from someone in the human world are added to that god of death's life.
Dealings,Light,Huh.
Dealings,Ryuk,"So it means that as long as we don't slack off, even if someone was to shoot us in the head, or stab us in the heart with a knife, a god of death cannot die. On the other hand, no matter how many names you write in your Death Note, your lifespan will not increase. That is the first difference between gods of death and humans who possess a Death Note."
Dealings,Light,[Laughs] That's something about Shinigami that I haven't heard before. Pretty interesting stuff.
Dealings,Ryuk,The second difference between us will probably be of even greater interest to you. Though this has less to do with lengthening life and more to do with cutting it short.
Dealings,Light,What do you mean cutting it short?
Dealings,Ryuk,"Shinigami can tell what the person's name is by just looking at their face. We know instantly. And do you have any idea why? Because through a Shinigami's eyes, a human's name can be seen above their head. Not only that, we see their lifespan as well."
Dealings,Light,Their name and lifespan?
Dealings,Ryuk,"That's right. I'm able to see your name and lifespan right now. If I converted that to human time, I could tell you how many years you got left. But there's no way I'd ever tell you that. I may have a big mouth, but even I wouldn't go that far. [Laughs] Shinigami never have to worry that they won't be able to kill a person just because they don't know their name, and every time we do take a life, we always know exactly how many years we are going to receive. Our eyes just aren't the same, and that is the difference between you and I. However, if a Shinigami drops his Death Note and a human picks it up, he can grant that human the eyes of a Shinigami, but only if a deal is made, one that has been with us since ancient times."
Dealings,Light,And what's the deal?
Dealings,Ryuk,The price for having the Shinigami's eyes…is half of that person's remaining lifespan. That's all it is.
Dealings,Light,Half of my remaining lifespan?
Dealings,Ryuk,"Yeah. In other words, if you are supposed to live another fifty years, it'll be twenty-five. If it was one more year, then six months."
Dealings,Light,"I see. And since you've made it clear you're not on anyone's side, you won't help me out. You wouldn't just give me the names of people I want to kill. Basically, you're saying that I can't simply borrow your powers. I'd have to pay for them."
Dealings,Ryuk,"That's right. It's a key part of the code that all Shinigami are bound by. I'll say this once more. Give me half your remaining lifespan, and I'll give you the Shinigami Eyes."
Dealings,Light,"If I agree, I'll be able to know everyone's name just by looking at them. If I had that power, the Death Note would only be easier to use."
Dealings,Ryuk,"So, what'll it be, Light? Is it a deal?"
Dealings,Light,Everything has turned out exactly as I wrote it in the Death Note to the last detail. 11:45 on the dot. Everything is going just as I planned. The Death Note never fails.
Pursuit,Soichiro,[V.O.] What? I don't believe this. Another twenty-three victims yesterday? Are these confirmed?
Pursuit,L,"[V.O.] As soon as began to suspect that Kira might be a student, the pacing of the killings changed, as if to contradict that theory. This can only mean that Kira has access to police information."
Pursuit,Light,"[V.O.] When L discovers that I'm somehow getting confidential information, he'll be obligated to start investigating the police to find the source of the leak."
Pursuit,Ryuk,[V.O.] You're being followed by another human. He's watching you right now.
Pursuit,Light,[V.O.] That's a problem. I'll have to get rid of him as soon as possible.
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Because through a Shinigami's eyes a human's name can be seen above their head. Not only that, we see there lifespan as well. However, if a Shinigami drops his Death Note, and a human picks it up, he can grant that human the eyes of a Shinigami. The price for having a Shinigami's eyes is half of that person's remaining lifespan. That's all it is. So... what'll it be, Light? Is it a deal?"
Pursuit,Shinigami 1,Has anyone seen Ryuk around?
Pursuit,Shinigami 2,Maybe he was serious about losing his Death Note.
Pursuit,Shinigami 3,[O.S.] It was probably picked up by some human before he could get to it.
Pursuit,Shinigami 4,No way. Then he'd be stuck there 'til the end of that human's life or until the Death Note was destroyed. That could take a while.
Pursuit,Armonia Justin Beyondormason,Yeah. I can't picture Ryuk doing something so boring.
Pursuit,Shinigami 5,[O.S.] Do you know what? I actually heard he was carrying two Death Notes.
Pursuit,Shinigami 6,"[O.S.] Seriously, why would he need two?"
Pursuit,Armonia Justin Beyondormason,Beats me. I'll never understand that guy.
Pursuit,Light,"So the price for receiving the eyes of the Shinigami is no more than half of my remaining lifespan? [pauses] That's it, right?"
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Yes. Well then, do we have a deal or not?"
Pursuit,Light,Ryuk. [pauses] This deal is... out of the question.
Pursuit,Ryuk,Huh?
Pursuit,Light,"Let's get this straight. [cut back] My plan is to create an ideal new world free from evil and all criminals, and I intend to reign as a god in that new world for a very long time. I might consider the deal if it lengthened my life, but not if I die sooner. I figured you of all people should know I wouldn't take this deal."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Yeah. I still felt I should tell you that the deal existed, just in case. Anyway, I've done my part. I don't need you complaining I didn't tell you this earlier on."
Pursuit,Light,"This is what you call ""telling me early on""? Doncha you think you're a little late? I don't see why you couldn't'a told me this when we met. Or better yet, you could've simply included it in the instructions for the Death Note."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Uh, good point. [thinking] He's not the slightest bit daunted by the fact that I'm a Shinigami. He doesn't suck up to me, and he seems to have no problem giving me a hard time."
Pursuit,Light,"[getting up from his desk and walking away] Well, you sure there's nothing else you want to tell me ""ahead of time,"" [pauses as he lays back onto his bed] ""Shinigami""?"
Pursuit,Ryuk,"No, nothing else. [thinking] Eh, probably."
Pursuit,Light,Really? That's too bad.
Pursuit,Ryuk,Whaddya mean?
Pursuit,Light,"You know, Ryuk, I might've seriously considered the deal if you'd offered me wings instead of eyes. Just the idea of flying 'round freely in the sky sounds very god-like. After all, it's been mankind's dream since antiquity to be able to fly."
Pursuit,Ryuk,[slightly surprised] You'd stand out if you sprouted wings and flew around. Not to mention the police would have no trouble finding you.
Pursuit,Light,"[laughs softly] I was only joking. Anyway, if I keep bargaining for eyes and wings and whatever else, next thing you know I'm going to end up becoming a real Shinigami. Though who knows? I bet that could be pretty interesting."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"I wouldn't worry. Even without the eyes and wings, you're already a worthy Shinigami."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"[V.O.] The Shinigami realm is slowly rotting. We lead meaningless and empty lives. And the only reason we still take human lives is because we're afraid to die ourselves. The truth of the matter is that we no longer even know why we exist. In fact, I doubt there's any reason for our existence at all."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"[cont'd] What I'm saying is, compared to that, you're becoming a much more impressive Shinigami."
Pursuit,Light,"I don't know about that. I mean, from what you're telling me it, it sounds like I'm doing a lot more work than they are, but uh I don't want to be compared to a Shinigami. I'm a human using this Death Note to make the world a better place for humans. [flips through the Death Note] But I wouldn't necessarily say the Shinigami realm is meaningless to humans either."
Pursuit,Ryuk,Huh? Why do you say that?
Pursuit,Light,"Well, just think about it. Whenever a Shinigami like you comes to the human world once ever hundred—no more like every thousand years—the human world changes dramatically. The existence of the Shinigami Realm is extremely significant."
Pursuit,Ryuk,Really?
Pursuit,Light,"And you told me just now that the Shinigami realm is slowly rotting, right? Well, when you return from this world, why not use what you've learned here to try and change it for the better?"
Pursuit,Ryuk,"[after a pause] Well, Light, I'm not sure why I never noticed this until now, but you're quite the positive thinker."
Pursuit,Light,"[laughs softly] Yeah, of course I am. That's why I'm using the Death Note to create a better world. You have to be a positive thinker to even attempt something like this."
Pursuit,Light,[cont'd] That's it. I got it.
Pursuit,Ryuk,Got what? What's this about?
Pursuit,Light,I think I just figured out how to find out the name of the guy who was following me today.
Pursuit,Ryuk,How're ya gonna do that?
Pursuit,Light,"I'm gonna use the rules of the Death Note to my advantage. I already know that if I write down a cause of death, I've got six minutes and forty seconds to record the conditions and exact time of death. First, I need to know exactly how far I can go in terms of specifying the details of death. ...This should be interesting."
Pursuit,Soichiro,"Yeah, it's me. ...Another six inmates were found dead last night? ...All were heart attacks? It's him... What? [an officer gasps] Bizarre behavior before they died? Could you be more specific? What do you mean? So they didn't just die from heart attacks."
Pursuit,Caller,"No, what I'm saying is they all died of heart attacks, but it wasn't quite that simple."
Pursuit,Caller,"[cont'd] Before one of them died, he drew a pentagram on the wall of his cell with his own blood. [letter] Another left a letter, but it doesn't seem to be a will or anything meaningful. [photo] As for the third victim, he escaped from his cell and ran all the way to the staff bathrooms before he died."
Pursuit,L,"What is it, Watari?"
Pursuit,Watari,"[muffled output] Three more heart attack victims, but the circumstances of their deaths are different from what we've seen thus far."
Pursuit,L,"What do you mean by ""different""?"
Pursuit,Watari,[muffled output] I'm sending you a copy of a letter as well as pictures taken at the scene.
Pursuit,L,Okay.
Pursuit,L,"It sounds like he was afraid that Kira would fine him. It's believable that our victim might have been genuinely afraid and wrote this, but... We know Kira can control the time of death. What if he can also determine the actions in the moments leading up to death? In which case..."
Pursuit,L,[distorted by voice changer] Here.
Pursuit,Soichiro,[standing up] Huh?
Pursuit,L,"[distorted] We can't release details of these men's deaths to the media. As far as they're concerned, these are just heart attacks."
Pursuit,Soichiro,Huh...
Pursuit,L,"[distorted] I have reason to believe that Kira was performing some kind of ""test"" using these criminals. And if that's the case, we'd only be giving him the results of this information if we put it public."
Pursuit,Soichiro,Right. I understand.
Pursuit,Officer 1,So now he's experimenting on his victims?
Pursuit,Officer 2,Horrible.
Pursuit,Soichiro,"He's playing with people's lives, as if all this was just a game. It's unforgivable."
Pursuit,L,If Kira is really using criminals as test subjects... what is he trying to achieve?
Pursuit,Light,"Look at this, Ryuk. I think we're in luck. The results of yesterday's little ""test"" of ours has been downloaded onto my dad's computer. And these results are just as I suspected. The Death Note will work for what I have in mind."
Pursuit,Ryuk,Whaddya mean by that?
Pursuit,Light,One of 'em escaped and ran into the bathroom I had specified in the Death Note.
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] Another one drew the same symbol I had drawn in the bathroom before he died. And finally [the half of the screen with the cell is replaced with the previously seen letter] a third wrote the same letter I had written in the Death Note, word for word."
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] All three did exactly what I intended them to do. For the other three inmates, I purposely wrote conditions that were virtually impossible."
Pursuit,Ryuk,Huh?
Pursuit,Light,"With the first one, I wrote that he would die in front of the Eiffel Tower in one hour. However, everyone knows it's physically impossible to go from a prison in Japan to Paris, France in only one hour. Since this couldn't happen, he simply died of a heart attack in prison. The next was supposed to draw an exact picture of L's face on the prison wall. This also didn't happen. You can't draw someone you've never seen before."
Pursuit,Ryuk,[O.S.] Makes sense.
Pursuit,Light,"[V.O.] With the last one, I tried something slightly different. I specified that he would write a note that read, ""I know that L is suspicious of the Japanese police."""
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] To be honest, I actually expected this one to work, but it didn't end up happening. Which means, it's impossible to make someone write what they don't already know. Or at the very least, it has to be the kind of thing they could come up with on their own. Basically, even the Death Note can't do the impossible, but as long as it's within the realistic limits of what that person might do, I can control them as much as I want before they die."
Pursuit,Ryuk,That's very clever. But what's all this leading to? What's the point?
Pursuit,Light,"These latest victims will no doubt keep L and the police guessing. Even as we speak, he's probably trying to decipher all the clues I left for him. Especially that little note. That absolutely meaningless dying message."
Pursuit,L,"If Kira used those criminals to start an experiment of some sort, it means he's about to start something. If he moves now, there's a good chance the FBI will notice someone acting. But perhaps he has a different goal in mind altogether."
Pursuit,L,[cont'd] [O.S.] Could the pentagram and this letter be some kind of message?
Pursuit,L,[cont'd] [O.S.] Is this it?
Pursuit,Light,Alright. Time for the real thing.
Pursuit,Ryuk,"""Real thing""?"
Pursuit,Light,Yesterday on the news they said this drug addict tried to rob a bank but was unsuccessful.
Pursuit,Light,[cont'd] [O.S.] He attacked a few people and then ran away emptyhanded. I'll use him.
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] It's kinda last minute, but I'm sure I can find someone. I got a few people in mind."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"""A few people."" For what?"
Pursuit,Light,"You'll see. [putting phone to his ear] Believe it or not, I'm actually a rather popular guy, Ryuk."
Pursuit,Yuri,"Hello? ...Huh? Light? Oh, morning."
Pursuit,Light,[thinking] He's still following me. This whole thing would just be a waste of time if he wasn't following me.
Pursuit,Yuri,[waving] [calls out] Light!
Pursuit,Ryuk,A date?
Pursuit,Light,Yeah.
Pursuit,Light,[cont'd] It's a date no matter how you look at it. I'm sure even my stalker will see it that way.
Pursuit,Ryuk,"But this isn't just a date, is it? You said that you'd figured out a way o find your stalkers name. So tell me, what do you plan on doing?"
Pursuit,Light,"Huh? Come on, didn't you see what I wrote in the Death Note? I explained it in great detail."
Pursuit,Ryuk,No. Doing that would take all the fun out of it.
Pursuit,Light,"In that case, just be patient and watch what happens. [he approaches the bus shelter; to Yuri:] Sorry, did I keep you waiting?"
Pursuit,Yuri,"No, not at all. Anyway, I haven't been to Space Land since junior high! [clings to Light's arm] I'm so excited. And the best part is I have you all to myself!"
Pursuit,Light,"Uh, yeah."
Pursuit,Stranger,[thinking] During the week he goes to school and cram school at night.
Pursuit,Stranger,"[cont'd] [thinking] Dates on his day off. Normal kid, just a hardworking senior in high school. Chief Yagami's son, Light Yagami. [Stranger jots down notes in small notebook] No cause for suspicion."
Pursuit,Stranger,"[cont'd] [thinking] At any rate, I'll be done with my surveillance today, and that'll be it."
Pursuit,Yuri,"I don't get it, Light. Didn't you say you weren't going out until entrance exams were over?"
Pursuit,Light,That was before I scored number one on the national practice exams.
Pursuit,Yuri,[groans] [playfully] You're such a nerd. [giggles]
Pursuit,Light,"[thinking] It's him. He's here. Seven passengers excluding him, no one's in the way. Everything should go smoothly."
Pursuit,Osoreda,Stay in your seats unless you want to die.
Pursuit,Stranger,[thinking] A bus jacking? You gotta be kidding me.
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Everybody shut up! If anybody moves, I'm putting a bullet in their head. [to Sasaki] Alright, driver, you listen to me. I know you've got the number for Space Land's office on ya. Call 'em!"
Pursuit,Sasaki,O-okay.
Pursuit,Sasaki,"[on the phone] This-this is Sasaki, calling from Bus 1-7-4. [cut back]"
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Tell 'em what's going on—and no tricks, either."
Pursuit,Sasaki,"M-my bus has been hijacked, and he's holding a gun to my head."
Pursuit,Osoreda,[grabbing phone from Sasaki] Gimme that. [on the phone] You heard what he said. Now you listen up!
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Have a female staff member bring all the cash from Space Land's cash from yesterday. I know it's there. Have her meet us two bus stops from the park and don't make me wait. If you try to mess with me at all or try to get the police involved, I swear I'll kill everyone one of these passengers."
Pursuit,Yuri,Huh?
Pursuit,Light,"[V.O.] Yuri, don't be scared. As soon as he turns around, I'm going to grab the gun out of his hand."
Pursuit,Stranger,"Don't be stupid. That's risky. [leans closer] If it comes to that, I'll take care of it."
Pursuit,Stranger,"It's okay. We don't have to pass notes back and forth. As long as we keep it down, he won't be able to hear our voices over the sound of the engine."
Pursuit,Light,Do you have any proof you're not his accomplice? Why should we trust you?
Pursuit,Yuri,[timidly] Accomplice?
Pursuit,Light,"Yes, I've read about this before. The first hijacker comes in like he's working alone. Meanwhile, the second one pretends to be a hostage and stays in the very back just in case something goes wrong. [softly] What's the matter."
Pursuit,Yuri,[softly] You... you really think he is one?
Pursuit,Stranger,"[thinking] I... I have no choice. I'm sure Light Yagami isn't Kira. If he was, he could just kill this guy with a heart attack."
Pursuit,Stranger,Here's my proof. [Light takes it] Take a look.
Pursuit,Light,"[thinking] FBI? I see. L needed an outsider, so he got the FBI to investigate anyone connected to the Japanese Police Force. His name is... Raye Penber."
Pursuit,Light,I trust you. And I guess for the time being I won't bother asking what an FBI agent is doing on the bus in the first place. Do you have a gun?
Pursuit,Raye,"Yeah, I've got one."
Pursuit,Light,"So if it comes down to it, I can rely on you, right?"
Pursuit,Raye,Yes.
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Get the hell up, you old hag! You want me to shoot you right now?"
Pursuit,Raye,[gasps] [thinking] That's right. This guy. His face was all over the local news just a few days ago.
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Look at me when I'm talking to you, grandma! I said shut up! [growls]"
Pursuit,Raye,[cont'd] [thinking] Some junkie. He tried to rob a bank and then killed three people before he got away. He's extremely dangerous.
Pursuit,Light,"[smugly thinking] We're safe. He won't shoot us. In fact, he's not gonna do anything."
Pursuit,Osoreda,"[shouting] Don't move, you little punk!"
Pursuit,Osoreda,"[shouting] What the hell is that? [pause] Eh, smartass! [picking up note] You guys were planning something back here, weren'cha?"
Pursuit,Raye,"[thinking] Damn it! If he sees that note from before, he'll find out that Light was planning to jump him and take his gun away!"
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Pft. Plans for a date, huh? [crumples and tosses note to Light] Stupid kid."
Pursuit,Light,[thinking] Gotcha.
Pursuit,Osoreda,Huh?
Pursuit,Osoeda,[shouting frantically] Wh-who the hell are you? You in the very back? What do you think you're doing?
Pursuit,Osoreda,[shouting frantically] Don't mess with me!
Pursuit,Osoreda,[shouting frantically] How long have you been hiding back there?
Pursuit,Ryuk,What's this? [tilts head] You're talking to me? [steps forward] So you mean you can actually see me right now?
Pursuit,Osoreda,"[gasps] Stay there, you! You—Keep away from me, you freak!"
Pursuit,Raye,[thinking] This isn't good. He's hallucinating! [quickly leans forward] [shouting] Everyone! Get down!
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Oh, I get it! That little note that Light ""accidentally"" dropped, was actually torn from the pages of the Death Note itself. Since he tricked this guy into TOUCHING the paper, he's the only other one on the bus who can see me. [walking towards Osoreda] That's so smart!"
Pursuit,Osoreda,[stumbling back] [shouting frantically] Get away!
Pursuit,Soichiro,"Sorry, pal. I'm a Shinigami, so I'm afraid your bullets aren't gonna kill me."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"""Anyone who touches the Death Note can see me."" ""I have to stay 'til the Death Note is finished or you die—whichever comes first."" And ""a Shinigami can't die from being shot."" I've said all these things at one time or another. Well, he is the top-ranked student in the country. [Raye gets up from his seat and runs forward] He even used this hijacking as a way to get the guy following him to willingly give up his name."
Pursuit,Osoreda,Stop the bus. [shouting] Let me off!
Pursuit,Light,[thinking] Eleven forty-five on the dot. Everything went just as I planned.
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] ""Kiichiro Osoreda. Accidental death."""
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] ""Boards the 11:31 Space Land-bound bus near the eastern entrance to the park, holding a loaded gun, and attempts to hijack the bus. He sees a horrific phantom and empties his gun trying to kill it. Terrified, he leaves the bus. Immediately afterwards, at 11:45, he dies when struck by a car."""
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] [thinking] The Death Note never fails. [cut to Raye] You will be next, Raye Penber."
Pursuit,Light,"[V.O.] It's just as I thought. He doesn't suspect me at all. The remaining investigators will all die of heart attack. Farewell, Raye Penber."
Tactics,Raye,You there.
Tactics,Light,Yeah?
Tactics,Raye,"Listen carefully: I came to Japan as a part of a secret investigation, so the local police can't find out that, um... that I."
Tactics,Light,I understand. I promise I won’t tell anyone that I met you and of course [pauses] that includes my father.
Tactics,Raye,"[sighs softly in relief] Well then, [runs away] please excuse me."
Tactics,Light,"[thinking] It's just as I thought. Anyway, I don't want the police to know that I've come into contact with an FBI agent, either. If my father ever found out, there's no doubt he'd let L know. [brief shot of Raye Penber] It's obvious that he doesn't suspect me. And as for the police, I'm sure they'll treat this as just another unfortunate accident."
Tactics,Woman,"[gladly] Hey, welcome back."
Tactics,Raye,[wearily] What a day.
Tactics,Woman,"Raye, what's the matter? Something happened, didn't it? [walking towards nearby shelf] I've never heard you sigh like that."
Tactics,Raye,"Yeah. The bus I was on got hijacked, if you can believe it."
Tactics,Woman,[shocked] A bus jacking?
Tactics,Raye,"Some junkie. Robbed a bank two days ago, and I guess he wanted to try taking on a bus today. I didn't think this kind of thing happened here."
Tactics,Woman,So you were already on the bus when the hijacker got on it?
Tactics,Raye,"Yeah, and in the end the guy freaked out, jumped out of the bus, and got hit by a car."
Tactics,Woman,Did he die?
Tactics,Raye,"Yeah, probably. I couldn’t really sick are and see what happened to him."
Tactics,Raye,[cautiously] What do you mean?
Tactics,Woman,"Think about it. You got on that bus because you were investigating someone, right? And now you're telling me that this criminal is most likely dead. Doesn't that suggest that you—"
Tactics,Raye,[interrupting] That's enough.
Tactics,Raye,"[increasingly frustrated]Look, darling, you and I know you used to be one of the best agents in the FBI. But now you’re my fiancé now. I mean, we talked about this. You're not an agent anymore, so just leave it alone."
Tactics,Woman,[after a pause] But...
Tactics,Raye,"[frustratedly] You wouldn't get involved with the Kira care and you wouldn't do anything dangerous. That's what you promised when we decided you’d come with me, so I could meet your parents in Japan. You do remember that, don't you?"
Tactics,Woman,"[disheartened] Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just force of habit. Sorry about that."
Tactics,Raye,"No, I should be sorry. Let's... forget about it. [happily] Anyway, once we have a few kids running around, you'll probably be so busy you'll forget you were ever an agent. Your mind will be occupied with better things, too."
Tactics,Raye,"[cont'd] More importantly, tell me how I can convince your dad I'm worthy of his daughter. Kira doesn't scare me half as much as he does."
Tactics,Ryuk,"Oh, let me guess. You're about to write down the name of that agent, aren't you? The one from the bus."
Tactics,Light,"Not yet. I'm gonna wait one week before writing his name. If he dies right after meeting me, I'll only draw attention to myself. I'll write his name in here once they've had time to investigate more people with ties to the police. It'll be less obvious that way. In the meantime, I think I'll use some of those inmates I've been keeping alive to play around with L a little more."
Tactics,Watari,[muffled output] L.
Tactics,L,[turning to the computer] Hmm?
Tactics,Watari,Another victim. This one left what appears to be a suicide note.
Tactics,L,"Please, send it to me."
Tactics,L,"""Gods of Death."""
Tactics,L,"""L, did you know, Gods of Death...?"" Is he trying to tell us that Gods of Death exist? [to Watari:] Listen, Watari. Tell the police to monitor prison populations closely for the next few days. Kira may use other suicide notes to communicate us."
Tactics,Watari,[muffled output] Understood.
Tactics,Ryuk,This place is crawling with humans. How're ya gonna do it here?
Tactics,Light,[scanning the crowd] Let's just say you're about to see the results of all the research and experiments I've been doing over the last few days.
Tactics,Ryuk,Experiments?
Tactics,Light,Yeah. I've been using known criminals who live in this part of town to test out different killing methods. I've learned a lot about the Death Note.
Tactics,Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] For example, if I write a cause of death and the circumstances leading up to it, I can add a name afterwards and it'll still happen."
Tactics,Ryuk,[thinking] Ooooh. Even I didn't know that one.
Tactics,Light,[putting hood on] He's here. [pauses as Raye approaches] Right on time.
Tactics,Light,Mr. Raye Penber.
Tactics,Light,Turn around and your dead.
Tactics,Light,I am Kira.
Tactics,Light,[cont'd] That's right. Don't turn around or put your hands in your pockets. I won't hesitate to kill you here.
Tactics,Raye,[thinking] I-it couldn't be. This voice. I've heard it somewhere.
Tactics,Light,"But first, I'm gonna prove to you that I'm Kira. Do you see the man working over there at the coffee shop?"
Tactics,Light,"That's right, the one sweeping the floor. I'm gonna kill him just for you."
Tactics,Ryuk,But how? ...Don't do it.
Tactics,Light,"I'm afraid I had no choice but to kill him. I figured if I didn't kill at least one person, you wouldn't believe me. Although that man has been repeatedly charged with sexual assault. He's managed to avoid conviction every time due to lack of evidence. He was a menace to society. He got what he deserved. I can only assume that L has already informed you of this: I can't kill someone who I haven't seen. I have to know their face, which means of course, I could easily kill all these people right now if I wanted to. Go ahead and choose someone if you want."
Tactics,Raye,D-don't do it. I believe you. You're Kira.
Tactics,Light,I'm sure you care more about your loved ones than any of these people here. Imagine how you'd feel if one of them was killed just because you refused to cooperate. I think you should consider them the real hostages at the moment.
Tactics,Raye,How do you know about her?
Tactics,Light,"[chuckles] You seem surprised. I've been investigating you, and if you don't do exactly as I say, she will die and so will the rest of your family, including you. And that's a promise."
Tactics,Raye,I-I understand. Just tell me what you need me to do.
Tactics,Light,I see you've got your laptop with you. I want the files containing the identities of all the FBI agents who came to Japan.
Tactics,Raye,"I do have my laptop with me. It's the one I use for work, but I don't have the files you're looking for."
Tactics,Light,"Alright, then take this envelope."
Tactics,Raye,Huh? [takes envelope]
Tactics,Light,"First, take the transceiver out of the envelope, then put the earpiece in, and await my instructions"
Tactics,Raye,[thinking] A transceiver? This thing looks like a toy.
Tactics,,"Fade to slightly different angle of Raye, at which point he has his hand on the transmitter now in his ear"
Tactics,Raye,[cont'd][thinking] But there'll be no record of this transmission anyway. And it allows us to converse from a close distance even underground. You really thought this through.
Tactics,Light,"Alright. Now get on the Yamanote Line, inner or outer route. It doesn't matter which direction you take. I'll be close by at all times, which means I'll be watching your every move. When you get on the train, pick a spot in front of you and don't take your eyes off it. If I see you looking around, I will kill you. Once you've boarded, I want you to take the seat closest to the doors. If it's occupied, wait until it's free."
Tactics,Light,"Now, I'm going to ask you something. If I have even the SLIGHTEST suspicion that you're not being honest, your girlfriend is as good as dead. How many FBI agents are currently in Japan? Speak quietly into the transceiver, and don't make it obvious."
Tactics,Raye,[lifts collar of jacket] I believe it's four teams. Three agents per team for a total of twelve.
Tactics,Light,Okay. Now take the papers out of the envelope.
Tactics,Raye,Huh? [thinking] What... is this?
Tactics,Light,"Of those twelve agents you mentioned, I want you to write down the name of your superior, the one who's heading up this investigation, on the space on the very top of the page."
Tactics,Raye,[thinking] What is the meaning of this? What is he after?
Tactics,Raye,"[cont'd][ thinking] Let's face it, he hasn't really left me any choice. Besides, it's not like he can kill them using just their names."
Tactics,Light,"Next, take out your laptop and turn it on. Any minute now your boss is going to send you a message with a file attachment. It contains the names and photos of all the FBI agents currently active in Japan."
Tactics,Raye,[thinking] But this... this is...
Tactics,Light,"Now, one by one you're going to look at each photo and then write that agent's name in the space provided. You're going to do this for each agent."
Tactics,Raye,"[thinking] It doesn't make sense. If he's got the names already, why use me? What's he planning to do with them? [closes laptop]"
Tactics,Light,"Good. Looks like you're done. [cut to Light] Now put the transceiver and all the papers back into the original envelope and place them on the wrack directly above your head. [cut to Raye putting papers in envelope] After that, you’re going to stay in your seat and ride the train for at least another thirty minutes. When you are absolutely certain that nobody will notice you leaving without the envelope, you can get off the train."
Tactics,Raye,[thinking] I know that voice. Why on earth can't I remember who it belongs to?
Tactics,Raye,"[thinking] Kira, who are you?"
Tactics,Raye,Light... Yagami.
Tactics,Light,Farewell... Raye Penber.
Tactics,Light,"[V.O.] Raye Penber wrote all those names on pages taken from the Death Note. Ironic. Without even realizing it, he was actually signing a death warrant for all of his colleagues. As for Penber's boss, he died of a heart attack after sending all of his agents a file. And the other eleven investigators? [chuckles] They all died of heart attacks after receiving the same file."
Tactics,Watari,"[through speakers] L, you have a call from the director of the FBI."
Tactics,Director,"It's me. I've got a report in front of me right now stating all of our agents in Japan are dead. All twelve died of heart attacks. I can only assume that Kira is behind this. Look, I'm sorry but it's already decided. We're calling off our investigation."
Tactics,Watari,I have Chief Yagami on the line.
Tactics,Soichiro,"[through speakers] L, I just got off the phone with the director of the FBI. According to him, it seems that you arranged for the FBI to come to Japan and investigate everyone here associated with the task force."
Tactics,L,"Yes, I did."
Tactics,Soichiro,So how do you explain this? Are we now suspects in our own investigation?
Tactics,L,I felt that it was necessary to uncover Kira's identity.
Tactics,Soichiro,"I cannot accept that! I find it unbelievable that you would spy on us, the very people working with you on this case."
Tactics,Officer 1,"Hear that? Well, I knew all along we couldn't trust that guy."
Tactics,Officer 2,"More importantly, Kira killed those FBI agents, didn't he?"
Tactics,Officer 1,"It's obvious he'll kill anyone who gets in his way, whether they're criminals or not. [cut to L's room] So much for his sense of justice. He's a murderer."
Tactics,Watari,We have another victim. A note was found at the scene.
Tactics,L,Hmm...
Tactics,Light,"[V.O. ]""L, do you know, gods of death..."""
Tactics,L,Hmm?
Tactics,Light,"[cont'd][V.O] ""...love apples?"""
Tactics,L,"[thinking] Damn you, Kira."
Tactics,Woman,"He's dead. Raye's dead. No, he was... he was murdered by Kira."
Tactics,Sayu,"Um, so, what's with the family meeting, Dad?"
Tactics,Soichrio,"I figured you're going to find out sooner or later, so I might as well tell you now. I don't want you to be alarmed. I'm sure you've heard of this Kira investigation. Well, I'm currently in charge of it."
Tactics,Sayu,"[sits upright] What? Are you serious? That's totally awesome, Dad. You're the best cop ever!"
Tactics,Soichiro,That's not quite the point I'm trying to make.
Tactics,Sayu,Oh?
Tactics,Soichiro,"You see, the truth is, the FBI sent twelve of their agents to Japan to assist us in finding Kira, and all of them died yesterday?"
Tactics,Light,Does that mean they were all killed by Kira?
Tactics,Sayu,What?
Tactics,Soichiro,What I'm saying is there's a chance that Kira will actually try to kill anyone who comes after him. His crimes are ruthless and more frightening than anything we've seen. Many detectives have already quit.
Tactics,Sayu,"Dad, you should quit, too! I don't want you to die. What if he gets you?"
Tactics,Sachiko,That's right. Your life is so much more important than some job.
Tactics,Soichiro,I can't. I could never forgive myself if I walked away from this. I will not sit back and let evil triumph.
Tactics,Sayu,"But Dad, you..."
Tactics,Sachiko,"Please, dear..."
Tactics,Light,"[after a brief pause] I think it's honorable of you, Dad. [standing up from seat] I'm proud to be able to call you my father. [while exiting the room] And if anything should ever happen to you, I'm going to find Kira. [opens door and looks back] And make sure he gets executed."
Tactics,Soichiro,We now know that Kira doesn't just target criminals. He'll kill anyone who opposes him.
Tactics,,Cut indoors to Soichiro addressing the task force
Tactics,Soichiro,"[cont'd] It's quite possible that we might all be killed by Kira. Think of your own lives. Your families and all the others you'd be leaving behind. If anyone wants to leave this investigation, now is the time. You won't be demoted if you choose not to stay. You have my word. But if you're not absolutely sure, then we don't need you. You have to be willing to fight against him, even if that means making the ultimate sacrifice. That is all."
Tactics,Officer 3,So what're ya gonna do?
Tactics,Officer 4,I'm not sure.
Tactics,Sasaki,"Oh yeah, that's him alright. There's no doubt about it. I remember him because he told us to get down. But I don't really remember any of the other passengers."
Tactics,Woman,"I see. Well, thanks for talking with me anyway. I appreciate it."
Tactics,Woman,"It's a bit of a longshot, but if what I'm thinking is right, Kira could have been one of the passengers on the bus that day. And if that is the case, then I know that he's close enough to use this bus route."
Tactics,Soichiro,"Five men, huh? Well, six, including myself. Still, I'm grateful to see that there are as many as five of you willing to risk your lives to face evil."
Tactics,L,[distorted by voice changer] The fact that you've chosen to stay means you have a strong sense of justice. I trust all of you.
Tactics,Aizawa,"Hah, uh, hold on a second. L just said that he's decided to trust us now. But honestly, what reason do we have to trust him?"
Tactics,Ide,"Look, L. All of us have agreed to put our lives at risk to bring Kira to justice, so I hope you understand what this means. We're really sticking our necks out here."
Tactics,Aizawa,"But you never have to show your face, do you? You just give the orders. I don't see how you expect us to work alongside you under those conditions."
Tactics,Soichiro,"L, if all of us are going to work together on this investigation, and if you truly meant what you said about trusting the six of us, could you come here so we could all meet in person?"
Tactics,L,"[after a pause][distorted] The thought had already crossed my mind. After all, I did say that I trusted all of you."
Tactics,Ide,"Why is he seeking our help now? There's only six of us. He's solved all these difficult cases by himself in the past, so what makes this one so different? The way L's been conducting things so far, odds are he's gonna send a stand-in or a proxy of some kind to meet us instead of coming himself. It's not like we'd ever know."
Tactics,Aizawa,"A proxy, huh? Well, it is possible."
Tactics,Matsuda,"I believe L. I thnk we can trust him. And besides, I don't really see how we can solve this case without his help."
Tactics,Mogi,I agree.
Tactics,Matsuda,Why would he do something like that?
Tactics,Soichiro,"There were a number of people on the task force who distrusted L before this investigation began. And once we got started, we had detectives resigning left and right. Following that, classified information was leaked. So I'm not surprised that he didn't trust us."
Tactics,Matsuda,"In other words, he was waiting for the task force to get narrowed down to only those investigators he could trust. And to do that, he needed to weed out anyone who wasn't totally committed."
Tactics,Soichiro,Hmm...
Tactics,Ide,"[growls][walking away] If we're working with that guy, I’m leaving the task force. You don't have to worry. I won't try to follow you. I'm not interested in finding L."
Tactics,Sasaki,O-okay.
Tactics,Ukita,"Well, I think we can trust L, so I'd be willing to cooperate with him on this investigation."
Tactics,Aizawa,Count me in.
Tactics,L,"[distorted] I'm staying at a suite in the Teito Hotel at the moment, but I'll be switching hotels every few days from this point on. I want you to think of these hotel rooms as the de facto headquarters of this investigation. If this arrangement is acceptable to all of you, then split into two groups and stagger your arrival so you come thirty minute apart. Please arrange it so you're all here at midnight."
Tactics,L,"Kira. I seems we're getting closer to each other in equal steps. [takes deep breath] It's only a matter of time before we collide. So be it. I'm ready to show my face. I'll make my first public appearance as L. If you ever manage to find out about these secret meetings, I'm sure you'd feel compelled to move in. [takes deep breath] That's what I'm counting on."
Tactics,Light,[thinking] I've been quite active over these past few days. Think carefully. Was there anything I missed? What comes next? There are endless possibilities. The real battle is only just beginning. L...
Tactics,L,"[voice muffled from inside] It's unlocked. Please, let yourself in."
Tactics,Soichiro,Hmm...
Tactics,Light,This woman. If she had spoken to the police before I met her... But it seems there's a god on my side after all. And not just a god of death.
Unraveling,L,[monotone] I am L.
Unraveling,Soichiro,[thinking]] This is him?
Unraveling,Matsuda,Hmm. He's nothing like he thought I'd be.
Unraveling,Soichiro,"Hmm. [pulls out badge] I'm Yagami, of the NPA."
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Uh, Matsuda."
Unraveling,Aizawa,I'm Aizawa.
Unraveling,Mogi,Mogi.
Unraveling,Ukita,Ukita.
Unraveling,Soichiro,"I'm very sorry we're late. Currently, the five of us are—"
Unraveling,L,Bang!
Unraveling,Task force,Huh?
Unraveling,Matsuda,Uh?
Unraveling,Aizawa,What the hell was that?
Unraveling,L,"Hmm... If I were Kira, you'd be dead Mr. Soichiro Yagami for the NPA."
Unraveling,L,"Kira needs a face and a name in order to commit murder. But I'm sure you've already figured that much out, haven't you? Please, do not give out your names so carelessly. Instead, let's value our lives."
Unraveling,Matsuda,"I knew that he needed a face to kill someone, but I don't remember any evidence that showed that he needed a name, too."
Unraveling,Soichiro,"There's no way to verify if this is related, but criminals whose names were never released publicly or whose names were spelled incorrectly in the media have not been targeted. We briefly went over it at one of our meetings."
Unraveling,L,That's enough small talk for now. Come this way.
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Oh, uh, right."
Unraveling,L,"Please turn off all your cell phones, handhelds, and any other communication devices, and leave them on the table right there."
Unraveling,Aizawa,"What, do you think we're going to be using our cellphones during this meeting to leak information?"
Unraveling,Soichiro,It's alright. Just do as he says.
Unraveling,Matsuda,"[as they all place their cellphones on the table] I realize he's been cautious from the very beginning, but I still can't tell if he trusts us or not."
Unraveling,L,"[taking a seat] No, I just find them distracting. I can't stand it when people's cellphones are ringing while I'm trying to talk. Let me start by saying nobody takes notes on anything that's said in these meetings. That means when we leave headquarters, any information we need is committed to memory. Please, make yourselves comfortable."
Unraveling,Soichiro,Huh. Right.
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Excuse me, L?"
Unraveling,Woman,"Mmm, and from now on I'll have to ask that you stop calling me ""L"". It's ""Ryuzaki"" now, just to be safe."
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Uh, okay, Ryuzaki. If we know that he needs a name and a face to kill, couldn't we cut down on the number of victims by keeping criminals names from the news?"
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"If we do that, we'll only be putting the general public at risk."
Unraveling,Ukita,The general public?
Unraveling,Aizawa,Why?
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Kira is childish, and he hates losing."
Unraveling,Matsuda,But how do you...
Unraveling,Soichiro,Just what do you mean?
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Well, I'm also childish and I hate to lose. That's how I know. [sips tea]"
Unraveling,Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, would you mind being a little more specific for us."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Mnn, early on in the investigation, I tried to provoke Kira with that broadcast."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"[V.O.] Up until then, Kira would only go after criminals. But as we all witnessed, he didn't hesitate to kill my stand-in."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"[V.O.] Also, as soon as I said we knew he was in the Kanto region, in defiance, he made sure his next victims came from within Japan, as if to say, ""'n' what're you gonna do about it?"""
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Mmm. He's met each of my challenges head-on, and he's never missed an opportunity to return the favor. Now what do you think would happen if we tried to use media restrictions to hide criminals from someone like that?"
Unraveling,Matsuda,I guess...
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Hmm. ""If you choose to withhold the names of your worst criminals, I'll kill petty criminals or the innocent. I'm holding the whole world hostage, so who's it gonna be? I'm not the evil one here, but all those who oppose me by hiding criminals? You are truly evil."" [sighs] That's exactly how Kira thinks. In any case, let's look at another way we can use the media to draw him out."
Unraveling,Aizawa,But how?
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"How about something like this? ""Death of FBI agents infuriates the U.S. Latest killings anger the international policing community. Nations agree to send fifteen hundred investigators to Japan."""
Unraveling,Aizawa,Ah...
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"For Kira, this will be way beyond what he faced with the FBI. He'll see everyone as a potential threat. Psychologically, he'll start to feel cornered, and that will cause him to take some kind of drastic action."
Unraveling,Ukita,That's interesting.
Unraveling,Aizawa,"So he'll think there are fifteen hundred, when there are really only seven of us. And since none of these investigators exist, Kira won't be able to kill them."
Unraveling,Ukita,It just might work.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Well, before we celebrate, I'll tell you the rest of my thoughts on the Kira case."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,Kira works alone. He had access to all our classified information.
Unraveling,Aizawa,What evidence do you have that he's working alone?
Unraveling,Soichiro,"Hold on, Aizawa. Let's listen to his entire theory before asking questions."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"We know he needs a name and a face to kill. And to some extent he can control a victim's time of death and their actions before dying. We already know that much. Please keep that in mind [uncaps marker] and listen carefully to what I have to say next. [begins to write] On December fourteenth, twelve FBI investigators enter Japan. Here we are on December nineteenth. Using prison inmates, Kira conducts experiments manipulating his victims' actions before they die. In other words, during this window of only five days, Kira became aware of the FBI's presence and obviously felt threatened. Because he didn't know any of their names or faces, he was at a disadvantage. He needed to know how much control he had over his victims before he could use it against the twelve agents. And as we all know, on December twenty-seventh."
Unraveling,Light,"[thinking] I got a hold of a file which contained all the names and faces of the FBI investigators in Japan, and I succeeded in killing each one of them. It's practically impossible to guess which agent gave the file to Kira, but [brief flashback of interaction with Raye Penber] I have to make sure no one ever finds out that I came into contact with Raye Penber. [writes 12/10 BUS in notebook]"
Unraveling,Ryuk,Huh? How come you're not using the Death Note today? You studying for those entrance exams? [eats apple]
Unraveling,Light,"Those are the least of my worries. Plus, it's a little late to start now."
Unraveling,Ryuk,Oh? Whatcha doing?
Unraveling,Light,December nineteenth to December twenty-seventh. I've been most active during this period.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"During this period, to the best of our knowledge, at least twenty-three individuals died of heart attacks. But these victims were different from Kira's previous targets. They were all alleged criminals, ex-convicts, or suspects in on-going investigations, so legally speaking, they were innocent."
Unraveling,Soichiro,That's true.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"What this indicates, is that Kira had to manipulate these lesser criminals in order to kill those FBI agents. He killed that many people so we'd be unable to kill the decoys from those who were actually used. In truth, he probably only needed a few. He waited eight days so the FBI could investigate other suspects, which meant there'd be no timeline linking him to their deaths. I suspect Kira had to be one of the people being investigated by the FBI between the fourteenth and the nineteenth of December. In fact, I have no doubt. [scribbles out the line he drew between the fourteenth and nineteenth]"
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"These are files provided by the FBI, and they contain additional information you might find useful. For obvious reasons, you're not permitted to take these out of this room, but— [he gasps as he's interrupted]"
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Amazing! There might only be five of us, but with this much information, we should be able to cover a lot of ground."
Unraveling,Aizawa,"We'll split into two teams. One team traces the FBI agents, the other looks at the heart attack victims"
Unraveling,Matsuda,"There weren't that many people who had access to information from headquarters, and of those the FBI only investigated a small group in the first five days"
Unraveling,Aizawa,Yeah. Yeah!
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,So. Does anyone have any questions?
Unraveling,Task force,Huh?
Unraveling,Soichiro,"Actually, Ryuzaki, I do have one question for you. And it pertains to what you said to us earlier about how you hate to lose. Does that fact that you've shown us your face mean that you've lost? By just being here, are you admitting defeat to Kira?"
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"That's right. By showing my face to you know and by sacrificing the lives of twelve FBI agents, I have lost the battle. But I'm not gonna lose the war. This is the first time I've ever put my life on the line. I want to show Kira that we're all willing to risk our lives, if that what it takes, [chuckles and smiles] and that justice will prevail no matter what."
Unraveling,Mogi,"Hey, yeah, that's right!"
Unraveling,Matsuda,I like the sound of that.
Unraveling,Ukita,We can do this!
Unraveling,Aizawa,"Alright, then. Let's do this, Ryuzaki!"
Unraveling,Soichiro,"[thinking] Well, I had my doubts about whether it was really him at first, but there's no mistaking it. This man is L."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Before we go any further, I have to be absolutely sure that none of you are Kira, so I'll need to speak with each of you individually before you leave today."
Unraveling,Aizawa,What's the deal? He still doesn't trust us?
Unraveling,Soichiro,"No, I think it's a fair request. Try and see it from his perspective. Kira's been getting information from our headquarters from the very beginning, so there's a good chance he's one of us."
Unraveling,Matsuda,He's right. Working on this case has given us a chance to see him in person.
Unraveling,Aizawa,[in realization] He's risking his life to be here.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,[staring out window][thinking] Things are going well. Just one clue—a single decisive factor's all I need.
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] Just one oversight. A single piece of evidence is all it would take. It could cost me my life.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki and Light,Just one thing.
Unraveling,Ryuk,You already finished studying?
Unraveling,Light,"I guess. [thinking] I'll be fine. I haven't missed anything. The biggest risk I've taken so far was that busjacking incident. But they'll never be able to connect it with Kira. Fortunately for me, both the police and L don't know that Kira can kill people by means other than a heart attack. However, if anyone were to discover that, I'd be in a lot of trouble."
Unraveling,Sayu,Whaaaaaat? Does it have to be now?
Unraveling,Sachiko,"[holding out bag of clothes] Your father's been pulling overnighters with now change of clothes, so you're going to bring these to him."
Unraveling,Light,"But Mooooom, I totally promised my friends that I'd go out with them today."
Unraveling,Light,[having walked into the living room] Why don't I go? I could use a break.
Unraveling,Sayu,"Thanks, Light. I owe you one next time! [eats chips and chuckles]"
Unraveling,Ryuk,So I guess this will give you a chance to spy on the police.
Unraveling,Light,"I won't go further than the reception desk. [he opens his trap drawer and retrieves the Death Note, then rips out a page and folds it]"
Unraveling,Ryuk,"Ooooh, you're bringing a page. Planning to kill someone?"
Unraveling,Light,"No, but lately I've been bringing a page with me every time I go out, just in case."
Unraveling,Woman,"[thinking] That day. Raye said that he was planning to go to Shinjuku. That same day, four people died of heart attacks in the Shinjuku area, and there was the bus jacking."
Unraveling,Woman,[thinking] There's no way it was a coincidence.
Unraveling,Woman,[thinking] That's it! Kira can kill in other ways. It doesn't have to be a heart attack.
Unraveling,Voice mail,The mobile customer you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. For voicemail—
Unraveling,Light,That's unusual for Dad. [hangs up] I wonder if he's in a meeting right now.
Unraveling,Woman,"Please, I need to speak directly with someone from the special investigation task force. It's urgent."
Unraveling,Receptionist 1,"I'm sorry ma'am, but I can't help you. As I've told you already, there is no one at task force headquarters right now."
Unraveling,Woman,[sighs]
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] There's no one at headquarters? Dad's cell is turned off. What's going on?
Unraveling,Woman,Can't you contact them somehow? I have information relating to the Kira investigation.
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] The Kira investigation? [approaches]
Unraveling,Receptionist 1,"Look, I'll call headquarters one more time for you. [picks up phone] One moment."
Unraveling,Light,"[approaching desk with bag] Hi, I'm Detective Soichiro Yagami's son, Light Yagami. I brought my father a change of clothes, but it doesn't look like he's in. Can I leave them here?"
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"Sure. Hey, I haven't seen you in a while, Light."
Unraveling,Light,"Oh, I'm sorry, uh..."
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"What, you don't remember? You helped solve the insurance fraud murder investigation. Sometime last year. But hey, no one remembers the receptionist, do they?"
Unraveling,Light,"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm terrible with faces. I just need to sign my name on this form, right?"
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"So Light, does this mean you're gonna be helping us with the Kira investigation, too?"
Unraveling,Light,"Sure! If all goes well, maybe I'll find Kira before L does."
Unraveling,Woman,[looks up at Light][thinking] Find him before L does?
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"[hangs up phone] As I thought, there's no one at headquarters. You're going to have to trust me on this, ma'am. I'll be sure to give them your message as soon as I see them. I promise."
Unraveling,Woman,That's not good enough. I have to tell them in person!
Unraveling,Light,Excuse me?
Unraveling,Light,"My father is actually in charge of the Kira investigation. If you'd like, I could pass your message onto him. His cellphone is off at the moment, but I should be able to contact him soon. A number of FBI agents were just killed, and a lot of detectives have quit the case because they're afraid of Kira, so he's pretty busy right now"
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"Uh, Light, it's probably better if you don't discuss this with."
Unraveling,Light,"True, but it's practically common knowledge at this point. Besides, I feel like I can trust her. You can almost see it in her eyes. She's a wise and careful person. You heard about what happened, and you must have figured out that the police had a leak of some kind. And that's why you wanted to tell them in person. You thought this through. Well, am I right?"
Unraveling,Woman,[gasps]
Unraveling,Light,"I'm sure my father will call me once he checks his messages. When he does, I'll give you the phone and let you talk to him."
Unraveling,Woman,[they stop] You're sure that's alright?
Unraveling,Light,"Oh yeah. You understand why I can't just give you my father's cell phone number, but I have no problem letting you use my phone to talk to him. You'll have to trust my father and I, which I hope won't be too difficult for you. [laughs]"
Unraveling,Ryuk,[thinking] Why is he so happy?
Unraveling,Woman,[bows] Thank you so much.
Unraveling,Ryuk,"[laughs] She walked right into that one, didn't she?"
Unraveling,Light,"I've gotta say, you must be pretty brave to be getting involved in the Kira case like this."
Unraveling,Woman,"Oh, not really."
Unraveling,Light,"So according to you, is Kira some [clears throat]. Um, we've been talking, and I just realized I don't even know your name. My name is Light Yagami. ""Light""'s written with the character for ""moon"" and ""Yagami"" for the characters ""night"" and ""god"". [chuckles] Kinda weird, huh?"
Unraveling,Shoko,"My name's Shoko Maki. It's written with the characters for ""shining"". ""Ko"" as in ""child"" space and ""ki"" as in ""tree""."
Unraveling,Light,"Miss Maki, right?"
Unraveling,Light,"Miss Maki, I've been thinking about Kira's powers, and I believe they somehow enable him to control his victims before they die."
Unraveling,Shoko,"So do I! It's odd that you say that, because that's exactly what I've been thinking. Kira's able to control their actions before he kills them, but there's more to it. If my analysis so far is correct, Kira can kill in a number of ways, not just with a heart attack."
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] She knows? Who is this woman?
Unraveling,Shoko,"I don't think anyone else knows this yet. But if the police are willing to consider it, I bet it could help them catch Kira."
Unraveling,Light,"You know, that possibility never even crossed my mind. So what you're saying is, any time Kira wants one of his murders to go undetected, he wouldn't use a heart attack."
Unraveling,Shoko,Right. I'm almost positive someone I know may have met Kira.
Unraveling,Light,"Met Kira? [laughs] I'm sorry, but if a person came in saying they met Kira, the police would be more than a little skeptical, to say the least."
Unraveling,Shoko,"[dejectedly] I know. That's why I need to explain it in person to someone at task force headquarters. Otherwise, I'm afraid they'd just write me off"
Unraveling,Light,But wouldn't it be better if your friend spoke to them instead?
Unraveling,Shoko,"He probably would, but he's no longer alive. He was one of the twelve FBI agents who came to Japan to investigate Kira."
Unraveling,Light,[gasps][thinking] An FBI agent. Who met Kira. Could it be?
Unraveling,Shoko,"[echoing] You see, he was also my fiancé. While he was working, he got caught up in a bus-jacking, and I have reason to believe that he met Kira on that bus."
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] Raye Penber. [stops walking]
Unraveling,Shoko,[stops and turns around] Is something wrong?
Unraveling,Light,Nothing. I'm sorry to hear that he passed away. [they continue walking] So what makes you think he met Kira on that bus.
Unraveling,Shoko,"Because eight days after that bus was hijacked, he died, along with the other FBI investigators. The same man had attempted to rob a bank two days before he hijacked that bus, then he dies in an accident? Just like that? [chuckles] I mean, really, what are the odds? I've come to believe that Kira set up that bus-jacking. It was planned to bring him in contact with my fiancé, in order to obtain information on the identities of the other FBI agents, so he could get rid of them all. Anyway, what stands out to me is that the hijacker died in an accident. In other words, it suggests that heart attacks aren't the only way Kira can kill people. [stops at light]"
Unraveling,Light,"Okay, so the busjacker didn't die of a heart attack, and based on that, you're saying Kira has other ways of killing people?"
Unraveling,Shoko,Yes.
Unraveling,Light,"Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that's a bit of a leap of faith."
Unraveling,Shoko,"There's no other way of looking at it. If Kira was controlling the hijacker, chances are, he killed him, too."
Unraveling,Light,I still don't see it.
Unraveling,Shoko,"I've been wondering about that bus-jacking ever since my fiancé first told me about it. After he calmed down, I asked him for details. He didn't mention any names or anything like that, but he told me one thing."
Unraveling,Light,What did he say?
Unraveling,Shoko,That he'd been put in a situation where he had to show his FBI ID to someone.
Unraveling,Light,Hmm...
Unraveling,Shoko,The operation was undertaken secretly without the NPA's knowledge. He wasn't allowed to show his ID. I think whoever saw his ID that day is responsible for the deaths of all the agents.
Unraveling,Ryuk,[thinking] Unbelievable. She figured it out! This must be the oversight Light was worried about.
Unraveling,Light,"I understand. You're the only one who knows any of this, and you want nothing more than to avenge your fiancé by bringing Kria to justice, right? And now you're convinced that Kira can kill without using a heart attack?"
Unraveling,Shoko,Yes.
Unraveling,Light,"There's no doubt in my mind your deductive skills are excellent, but you can't deny that you have a personal interest in the case. Still, your theory is worth looking into. That's for sure. Your testimony could be central to the case."
Unraveling,Shoko,It could.
Unraveling,Light,"If what you're telling me is true, then it'll only be a matter of time before the police catch up with Kira. The person your fiancé showed his ID to on the bus that day, it had to be Kira."
Unraveling,Shoko,[nods] That's right.
Unraveling,Light,That was close. This woman. If she'd spoken to the police before I met her... But it seems there's a god on my side after all. And not just a god of death.
Unraveling,Light,"I have to admit, I'd really love to see how she dies, but I can't be caught following her around. Go on. Hurry to your death."
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] Regardless of how she came to the conclusion, the fact remains this woman knows the truth. If she gives this information to the police, it won't take them long to figure out that Kira is actually me. I have no choice but to eliminate her."
Overcast,Shoko,Something wrong?
Overcast,Light,"[stops] Oh, it's nothing. But the more I think about it, the more your theory makes sense to me. We can't waste any time. We need to start investigating it right away."
Overcast,Shoko,What? Really? Do you mean that?
Overcast,Light,Yes. So have you told anyone else about this?
Overcast,Shoko,No. You're the first person I've told.
Overcast,Ryuk,"[chuckles] You're lucky, but how can you get rid of her? It's not like you can do it here."
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] Well, you have a gift for stating the obvious, Ryuk. [reaches into pocket and pulls out paper from the Death Note and a pencil]"
Overcast,Ryuk,"Oh, aren't you bold."
Overcast,Light,Let's get started. Could you please tell me the date and time of the bus-jacking incident?
Overcast,Shoko,"It was December twentieth, in front of Asagao Hill, at 11:02 A.M., bound for Space Land."
Overcast,Light,"[writing] December twentieth, and they were on their way to Space Land."
Overcast,Shoko,Yes.
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] This way, no one will find her body. And even if they do, they'll just assume that the death of her fiancé drove her to commit suicide."
Overcast,Ryuk,[laughs]
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] Hmm? What's so funny, Ryuk?"
Overcast,Ryuzaki,"I apologize for questioning you all like that, but I am afraid I had no other choice."
Overcast,Ryuzaki,[cont'd] I've determined that Kira is not among us.
Overcast,Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, how can you be certain that we're all innocent?"
Overcast,Ryuzaki,"Well, to be honest, from the beginning I set a number of traps that would reveal if any of you was Kira. But after speaking with you one-on-one, I don't feel the need."
Overcast,Ryuzaki,Excuse me. [picks up phone]
Overcast,Matsuda,[thinking] Unbelievable. He tells us to turn off our cellphones.
Overcast,Ryuzaki,[on phone] Understood. I'm just about finished here anyway. You got the key so let yourself in. [hangs up] Watari is on his way.
Overcast,Light,"[putting paper and pencil in his pocket] So that's everything. I'd like to report this incident to my father, if it's okay with you, that is."
Overcast,Shoko,"Well, if it's all the same, I think I'd like to report it myself. And after talking to you, I've decided that it would be best to do it as soon as possible. [turns and starts walking]"
Overcast,Light,"[following] Uh, that makes sense. [thinking] Just ten seconds until 1:15. I have to admit, I'd really love to see how she dies, but I can't be caught following her around. [closeup of his watch ticking in the background] Go on. Hurry to your death."
Overcast,Shoko,Kira will definitely be caught. Don't you think?
Overcast,Light,"[eyes widening] Huh? ...Hmm [checks watch; ticking stops][thinking] What's going on? It should have happened already. This doesn't make sense. I don't understand why she's not leaving. I've had no problems making people kill themselves in the past. All I had to do is write the word ""suicide"". The criminals I tested it on all hung themselves exactly when I specified. My experiments indicate that in a situation like this, I should be able to control a person's actions. So what's wrong?"
Overcast,Ryuk,[laughs maniacally]
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] Ryuk... He laughed just like that when I was writing in the Death Note. And that's not all. I remember thinking how it was bizarre how he laughed when I asked for her name. In fact, he's reacted the same way every time her name comes up. An alias!"
Overcast,Watari,"Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet all of you."
Overcast,Aizawa,This person is Watari?
Overcast,Matsuda,"Um, what about your usual outfit?"
Overcast,Watari,"If I dressed like that, I'd be announcing to the world that I am ""Watari"". That's all it takes to give away the location of our headquarters and Ryuzaki."
Overcast,Matsuda,Oh. I see.
Overcast,Watari,"Ordinarily, I would never show my face to any of you. The fact that I'm here is proof that you've won Ryuzaki's trust."
Overcast,Matsuda,"[rubbing the back of his head] Now that you mention it, I do feel honored. [laughs nervously]"
Overcast,Watari,"[holding forth a silver briefcase] Well then, I've brought those items you requested. It's all here."
Overcast,Ryuzaki,Could you please pass them out to everyone?
Overcast,Watari,"Yes. [opens briefcase to reveal new police IDs] Gentlemen, these are your new police IDs."
Overcast,Aizawa,But what for?
Overcast,Light,[stops and turns to look at Light] I should probably be getting back soon.
Overcast,"""Shoko""",Hmm?
Overcast,Light,Someone from the task force might be back there by now.
Overcast,"""Shoko""","Oh, yeah, you could be right. Let's cross our fingers and hope someone's there."
Overcast,Light,"Yeah. [""walks off""]"
Overcast,"""Shoko""","[""thinking""] Dammit! I'm running out of options here. [""quietly growls and starts to follow Maki again""] I have to stop this before it's too late. Oh no. What if my father calls back now? I already promised her that I'd let her talk to him if he did. If this phone rings, it's all over for me. What am I gonna ""do""? [""pause""] This is crazy. All I have to do is turn my cellphone off. [""phone beeps off""] Problem solved. Now, calm down. You know what needs to be done. Just find out her real name. Her purse. Her pockets. She's gotta have a driver's license or some kind of personal identification on her somewhere. She's a woman after all. I suppose if I ""had"" to, I could use force. No... no, the last thing I want to do is make a scene in public. I've gotta get her somewhere isolated. But where? And what explanation could I give her? Ah, it would never work, she's too careful. I need a better approach. I can do this. I'm going to convince her to give me her real name."
Overcast,Light,"Hey, Light. You know, that deal I mentioned is still open. It's just like putting on contact lenses. Completely painless."
Overcast,Ryuk,"[""thinking""] Would I be giving to give up half my life, just so I could learn this woman's real name? ...No. I ""wouldn't"". In fact, it's not even worth considering. Now quit wasting my time! Just shut your mouth, Shinigami."
Overcast,Light,"[""stops and turns""] Excuse me."
Overcast,"""Shoko""","[""stops""] Yes?"
Overcast,Light,"Uh, do you still have business at the police station, then? I'd like to go there by myself, if you don't mind."
Overcast,"""Shoko""","[""pauses""] Yeah, no problem."
Overcast,Light,Our names and ranks are false.
Overcast,Soichiro,Why did you give us fake IDs?
Overcast,Matsuda,"As you know, Kira requires a name and a face to kill. [""sips tea""] We will confront him with that premise in mind. And I think it should be obvious why."
Overcast,Ryuzaki,"Yes, but of all people, the police shouldn't use fake IDs."
Overcast,Ukita,"Enough. What choice do we really have, given the capabilities of our enemy? As long as you're working on this case, I think we're going to need all the protection one can get. It would be foolish not to use them."
Overcast,Soichiro,"Yeah, you've got a good point."
Overcast,Matsuda,[nods] Uh-huh.
Overcast,Aizawa,"Remember, anytime you're in a situation where you have to give out your name to a stranger, make sure to use the name from your fake ID. Undestood?"
Overcast,Ryuzaki,Right.
Overcast,Matsuda,And be careful not to take them out while in the presence of other police officers. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that could cause problems for us.
Overcast,Ryuzaki,I understand.
Overcast,Aizawa,"[opening another silver briefcase on a table filled with belts] Very well, then. I'd like to request that you wear these at all times."
Overcast,Watari,Matsuda
Overcast,Matsuda,"Uh, belts?"
Overcast,Watari,Each one has a transmitter in the buckle. This will allow Ryuzaki to monitor your whereabouts. And when you press the buckle twice like this...
Overcast,Watari,"[cont'd] ...my cell phone will ring, displaying your name. [hangs up cell phone] And I'll call you back immediately, but you won't see my number displayed. In the morning, all of you will go to the police station as usual. Then, later on in the day, we'll use this method, we'll use this method to confirm the name of Ryuzaki's hotel and his room number. Please use this for emergencies as well"
Overcast,Matsuda,"[smiling and fiddling with his belt] No way, this is totally cool! I feel like some kind of secret agent going after Kira!"
Overcast,Soichiro,"Quiet, Matsuda! This is not the time to be fooling around. Knock it off!"
Overcast,Matsuda,"[dejectedly] Yes, sir."
Overcast,"""Shoko""","Thank you so much for everything you've done, Light. After talking to you, I feel much more confident about my theory."
Overcast,Light,Not at all
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] Considering that Ryuk mentioned that eye deal again, there's no doubt in my mind that she used an alias. At this rate, once she goes to the police with her theory about Kira being on that bus, and they look at all the people Raye Penber was investigating, it won't take them long to zero in on me."
Overcast,Ryuk,"[chuckles] Hey, she's leaving. So now what?"
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] I've got about five minutes before that woman gets to police headquarters. Think. I need her real name, and I don't have much time to spare."
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] If this woman makes it to the police station and someone from the task force has returned by then, it'll all be over for me. I've gotta find out a real name and eliminate her quickly. Only three minutes left until she reaches the station. Alright. [walks faster to catch up]"
Overcast,Ryuk,Oh? Whatcha doin'?
Overcast,Light,Excuse me.
Overcast,"""Shoko""",Yes?
Overcast,Light,There's something that I should probably tell you.
Overcast,"""Shoko""",Okay.
Overcast,Light,"The thing is, it'll be impossible for you to contact anyone from the task force directly."
Overcast,"""Shoko""",Huh?
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] That's right. Keep the conversation going. I just need to find something she can latch onto, and I've got her. Once she's comfortable, then I can get her real name. I can do this."
Overcast,"""Shoko""",[annoyed] I can't contact anyone? But why not?
Overcast,Light,Didn't you find it odd there was no one at task force headquarters?
Overcast,"""Shoko""","Uh, yeah, I did find it a bit strange, but I didn't..."
Overcast,Light,Let me explain: the task force has been organized so that its members can't be identified and nobody on the outside knows who's in charge
Overcast,"""Shoko""",Mmm...
Overcast,Light,"If the members names were ever made public or the structure of the task force was revealed, we'd likely see another tragedy along the lines of the one that claimed your fiance's life."
Overcast,"""Shoko""",I see.
Overcast,Light,"That's why you were told earlier that no one was at task force headquarters. What I'm trying to say is, you'll never be able to talk to someone directly from the task force, because the police simply won't allow it."
Overcast,Ryuk,[chuckles] That's pretty clever. I'm impressed.
Overcast,"""Shoko""","If this is supposed to be a secret, then how do you know so much?"
Overcast,Light,Very well. You leave me no choice. It's because I'm actually a member of the task force.
Overcast,Ryuk,Huh?
Overcast,"""Shoko""","I'm sorry. You're telling me that you're an agent. Yes. L is currently in charge of the task force, and he's leading our investigation."
Overcast,"""Shoko""","Yes. To be honest, I already suspected that."
Overcast,Light,"He was concerned that the task force had become to small. Many detectives had quit, fearing for their lives, and so despite the fact that I'm a high school student, he brought me on board to help out with the investigation. After all, I've helped them solve cases in the past."
Overcast,"""Shoko""","So L trusts you, then."
Overcast,Light,"I can go to task force headquarters whenever it suits me, and I'm allowed to investigate freely as I see fit. You see, these days the task force is made up of a chosen few. An elite group of people handpicked for the job by L. All are highly skill, well respected, and above all, trustworthy."
Overcast,Shoko,[gasps]
Overcast,Ryuk,[laughs]
Overcast,"""Shoko""","[pauses] Thanks for explaining, but just to be safe, I'd like to visit the task force headquarters again."
Overcast,Light,Huh?
Overcast,"""Shoko""",Goodbye. [walks away]
Overcast,Light,"Uh, please, wait a second! [runs to catch up] It's like I just told you. They won't let you talk to anyone."
Overcast,"""Shoko""","I know, but I was hoping I could speak with L directly."
Overcast,Light,[lets out small breath]
Overcast,Ryuzaki,"Oh, and come to think of it, who's at the police station right now?"
Overcast,Soichiro,"Actually, no one's there at the moment."
Overcast,Ryuzaki,That's not good news. We need someone there at all times. Work in shifts if you have to.
Overcast,Soichiro,"I understand. Aizawa, I'll put you in charge of that for today."
Overcast,Aizawaw,"[standing up] Yes, sir. I'm on my way. Won't take me long."
Overcast,Light,"[urgently] Miss Maki, please, wait a second! It's literally impossible to meet L. This is pointless!"
Overcast,"""Shoko""",You may be right. But I think that there's a chance that he'll meet with me.
Overcast,Light,Huh?
Overcast,"""Shoko""","Although the only contact I've had with him is following orders through a computer, he might remember who I am. You see, I worked under him in a case in the U.S. about two years ago."
Overcast,Light,A-are you serious? You worked under L?
Overcast,"""Shoko""","Yes. I didn't tell you this, but up until three months ago, I worked as an FBI agent."
Overcast,Light,"[gasps][thinking] This is it. Finally, something I can use. [aloud] Guess I shouldn't be surprised. In fact, I noticed early on that your investigative skills were far beyond those of an amateur."
Overcast,Light,"[cont'd] You're very cautious, and you seem to have a gift for getting to the heart of the matter. [starts walking away and stops when behind her] If I could, I'd like to learn from you."
Overcast,Ryuk,[laughs] One lie after another. You make it look easy.
Overcast,"""Shoko""","From the beginning, I knew I had to do things outside the regular channels, because from my perspective, both the police and the members of the task force were suspects. But I'm certain that I can trust L. Maybe it's unrealistic, but I think that if I go to the headquarters and give them my name, there's a chance that they'll let me speak with him directly."
Overcast,Light,"I see. But if the only person you could trust with this info was L, then why me?"
Overcast,"""Shoko""","I suppose I was upset that they wouldn't allow me to see anyone from the task force, and then you came along, claiming to be the son of the lead detective and... No, that's not it. I'll be honest with you. It's because, you remind me of L. There's something about you that's just like him."
Overcast,Light,Hmm... [turns around to face her] Will you investigate this case with me?
Overcast,"""Shoko""",Huh?
Overcast,Light,I want you to come work with us as part of the task force. We could use your help.
Overcast,Light,"[cont'd] Please, I know this is sudden, but the team needs people like you. I'm serious. You could be doing so much more than gathering information on your own. You have all the experience as an FBI agent, your more talented than most of the detectives currently on the task force, and L obviously trusted you in the past. It wouldn't be that difficult for you to join. All you'd need is some valid identification, a recommendation from a current task force member, and of course, you'd need to get L's permission."
Overcast,"""Shoko""",You want me to join the task force?
Overcast,Light,I can't help but think it must be fate that I met you today. I'd like to be the one to recommend you.
Overcast,Light,"[cont'd][rubbing the back of his head] Oh, I'm sorry about that. I guess I got a little bit too excited."
Overcast,"""Shoko""",It's okay. [chuckles]
Overcast,Light,"I mean, even if you acted as a consultant on this investigation, it would be a great help. I'm sure you have personal obligations to attend to. Not to mention the fact that you live in the United States."
Overcast,"""Shoko""","It's true. Before all this happened, I thought I'd continue living in America with my fiancé. We'd planned on getting married in the spring. But now he's gone, so I'm not sure what to do anymore."
Overcast,Light,"[thinking] Alright, I've come this far. All she needs is a little encouragement. [aloud] But you're young and beautiful and you've got your life ahead of you. Why put it all in danger for this"
Overcast,"""Shoko""","[desperately] No! Now that Raye's gone, I've got nothing to lose anymore. I want to catch Kira! I don't care about anything else. It's all I wanna do. Please let me investigate this case with you."
Overcast,Ryuk,Huh? [laughs hysterically]
Overcast,Light,"Yes, of course. I just need to see some form of identification before we proceed."
Overcast,"""Shoko""","Oh, um..."
Overcast,Light,Yes?
Overcast,"""Shoko""","You see, the name I gave you earlier, well, it wasn't actually my real name. [bows] I'm so sorry."
Overcast,Light,"Don't worry, it's all right. To be honest, I'm impressed by how incredibly thorough you've been. But I suppose that's just further proof of your capabilities."
Overcast,"""Shoko""","So will a Japanese driver's license do the trick, then?"
Overcast,Light,Sure.
Overcast,Light,[thinking] I made it in time.
Overcast,Naomi,"Uh, so, if you don't mind me asking, why do you keep checking your watch?"
Overcast,Light,"[Oh, well... I guess it's because... [checks his watch, which has almost hit the forty second mark] Because I'm Kira."
Overcast,Light,What's the matter?
Overcast,Naomi,There's something I have to do.
Overcast,Light,Hmm. [pulls out cellphone] My father's cellphone might be available now. Do you wanna see if you can talk to him?
Overcast,Naomi,"No, thank you. I have nothing to say to him."
Overcast,Light,"Then goodbye, Naomi Misora."
Overcast,Light,"Okay, so the busjacker didn't die of a heart attack, and based on that, you're saying Kira has other ways of killing people?"
Overcast,Light,"With Ryuk's information and my preparations, I can continue to kill criminals who names are broadcast on the news, while masquerading as a typical high school student studying for his entrance exams. Just watch me, L."
Glare,Aizawa,That was footage from surveillance cameras at the station. The death of one of the FBI agents is captured on here. [groans]
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Let's see the following scenes again: Raye Penber passing the ticket gate on his way in, then him boarding the train, then finally the part where he dies on the platform. [bites into ice cream]"
Glare,Aizawa,Okay. [sorting through surveillance tapes] Let's see...
Glare,Matsuda,I think it's next to that.
Glare,Aizawa,"Oh, here it is."
Glare,Matsuda,"[reviewing document] Um, so based on the records I have here, Raye Penber comes through the west entrance of Shinjuku Station at 3:11 PM. Then at 3:13 he boards a train on the Yamanote Line. But even if he was following someone at that time, I think it's going to be very difficult for us to draw any real conclusions from the blurry video. Then at exactually 4:42 P.M. a—"
Glare,Matsuda,"[cont'd] Nnn. Oh, thank you, Watari."
Glare,Matsuda,"Uuuumm, and at 4:42 P.M., he exits the train at Tokyo station and dies on the platform"
Glare,Ryuzaki,"It's quite strange, don’t you think?"
Glare,Aizawa,[happily with ice cream] Hah...
Glare,Soichiro,I'm sorry. What do you find strange?
Glare,Matsuda,"Yeah, what is it. Did you notice something?"
Glare,Ryuzaki,"[licks ice cream] Mmm. [swallows] We know that Raye Penber got on the train and then an hour and a half later he got off and died on the platform. But the Yamanote Line only takes an hour to complete its circuit. And more importantly, there's the envelope."
Glare,Aizawa,"Uh, whaddya mean?"
Glare,Ryuzaki,He's holding what looks like an envelope when he passes through the ticket gate.
Glare,Aizawa,"[gasps] You're right! It's there, under his arm! [looks at other screen] But in the footage right before his death, it's gone! I can't believe you actually caught that!"
Glare,Soichiro,"[grabs paper] Well, I don't see an envelope on this list of his personal effects."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Which means it was left on the train. And if you watch closely, at the very end here... [fastforwards tape to Raye dying on platform] it seems like he's straining to look inside the train before the doors close. You can see right here."
Glare,Soichiro,"If that's the case, do you think it could mean something?"
Glare,Ryuzaki,Wouldn't it be interesting if Kira was on that train?
Glare,Soichiro,That's impossible!
Glare,Ryuzaki,"I admit, I find it hard to believe as well. There's no reason for Kira to come to the scene of his own crime when he can kill from a distance. [takes breath] Well... maybe he was counting on us to make that assumption, and figured he could get away with such a bold move. [eats ice cream] Mmm..."
Glare,Ryuk,"[offscreen] What's going on with you, Light?"
Glare,Ryuk,[cont'd] You haven't stopped writing criminals' names in the Death Note for four days straight. So what are you trying to prove? I don't see the point of writing these names weeks in advance. I've never seen the Death Note used like this.
Glare,Light,"Consider it insurance. Suppose the son of the Detective Superintendent of the NPA was hospitalized. If criminals stop dying at the same time, it wouldn't be difficult to connect the two."
Glare,Ryuk,So that's what this is.
Glare,Light,Are you sure that I can use any date as long as it's before the end of a person's predetermined lifespan?
Glare,Ryuk,"Well, I can't guarantee it, because we Shinigami don't normally work that way, but I suppose any time before the end of their lifespan should work."
Glare,Light,"I really can't count on you, can I?"
Glare,Ryuk,Ya got that right.
Glare,Watari,"[on phone] Yes? Yes, would you please hold for a moment? [to Ryuzaki] Ryuzaki, it's Ukita at the NPA. He says he's on the phone with someone from the tip-line who has information for us."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Right. Then give Ukita the number for line five and ask him to have the informant call that line instead. It'll be safer that way. Mr. Matsuda, it's okay for you to turn your cellphone on now. Actually, please turn it on right away."
Glare,Matsuda,"Uh, sure."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"[using fake voice] Yes, this is Suzuki, head of Kira investigation Public Information Division. [pauses][in real voice] Raye Penber's fiancée? Naomi Misora..."
Glare,Ryuzaki,[cont'd] I've heard that name before...
Glare,Ryuzaki,"[gasps] [thinking] So it's her. She's from the Los Angeles BB Murder Case. That's right! She was working under me. I guess she must have come to Japan with her fiancé. [hangs up cellphone and hands it to Matsuda][aloud] Well, apparently she's been missing since the day after her fiancé died."
Glare,Matsuda,I'm sure that anyone in her situation would be pretty depressed. Was it...?
Glare,Aizawa,Suicide.
Glare,Ryuzaki,"No. The Naomi Misora I knew was strong. Not to mention she was also an excellent FBI agent. If anything, it's more likely that she'd be trying to catch Kira. It appears she came to Japan with Penber, it's possible that she may have found a lead... [thinking] If that's the case, did Kira manage to get to her first? [aloud] Everyone. At this point, I'd like to focus our investigation on only those people who Raye Penber was tailing. In particular, he was assigned to two police officers and those closest to them."
Glare,Soichiro,Very well. Who are these two individuals he was investigating?
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Deputy Director Kitamura, along with Detective Superintendent Yagami and their families."
Glare,Soichiro,[gasps]
Glare,Ryuzaki,"At this stage, I'd like to place wiretaps and surveillance cameras in both households."
Glare,Light,"[thinking] I have to make sure there's no evidence left on this computer, just in case someone goes through it. Now I just have to hide these clippings from the Death Note in here."
Glare,Ryuk,"It seems you're pretty skilled with your hands. I bet you're pretty popular with the girls, aren't you?"
Glare,Light,"Skill has nothing to do with it. It's your looks that count. I'm guessing you're not that popular, are you?"
Glare,Ryuk,[upset] Huh?
Glare,Matsuda,Surveillance cameras? Ryuzaki!
Glare,Aizawa,"I don't see how you could even consider this. If this got out, we'd have a civil rights scandal on our hands! We'd all lose our jobs."
Glare,Ryuzaki,You told me you'd be willing to risk your lives for this investigation. But you wouldn't risk your jobs?
Glare,Matsuda,"Uh, uh..."
Glare,Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, what are the odds that Kira is in one of those households."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Maybe ten percent. No, it's closer to five percent."
Glare,Matsuda,"Seriously? I'm sorry, but it's not worth the risk."
Glare,Soichiro,No.
Glare,Aizawa and Matsuda,[gasp]
Glare,Soichiro,"[cont'd] Of all the people we've investigated so far, not one of them seemed even the least bit suspicious. Even if there's only a one percent chance, we simply can't afford to ignore it."
Glare,Matsuda,Chief?
Glare,Soichiro,"I don't have to tell you how offended I am to learn my family is under suspicion. Having said that, just go ahead with it."
Glare,Aizawa and Matsuda,[gasp]
Glare,Soichiro,"[cont'd] And make sure you install them everywhere. I don't wany blind spots in the house, and that includes the bathroom."
Glare,Ryuzaki,Thank you very much. That was my intention
Glare,Aizawa,"Come on, Chief, you don't have to agree to this!"
Glare,Matsuda,"Yes, he's right! Think about your family! You have a wife and daughter at home, don't you?"
Glare,Soichiro,"[spins around][angrily] Yes, I'm well aware of that fact! But there is no point of doing this if we can't be thorough! Now I suggest you keep quiet!"
Glare,Matsuda,I'm sorry.
Glare,Soichiro,"No, it's okay. Excuse me."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"As a courtesy to the chief and his family, only he and I will conduct surveillance of their home. Watari, how long will it take to prepare the wiretaps and cameras we need?"
Glare,Watari,"Well, starting tomorrow, I can set them up at any time, provided we know when both houses will be empty."
Glare,Light's friend,"[offscreen] See ya later, Light!"
Glare,Light,"Yeah, see ya tomorrow. [he grabs the doorhandle to find it's locked][thinking] What? No one's home yet?"
Glare,Light,[taking off shoes] I'm home!
Glare,Light,Huh? Hmm...
Glare,Ryuk,"How's it going? I don't think anyone else is in the house right now. Do you wanna play some videogames? [Light lays down on his bed, ignoring Ryuk] Come on, it's been a while!"
Glare,Ryuk,You listening?
Glare,Soichiro,I don't believe it. I never knew he went to such great lengths. What could he be hiding in their that he doesn't want anyone else to see?
Glare,Ryuzaki,"For a seventeen-year-old kid, I wouldn't say this kind of behavior's particularly abnormal. When I was his age, I did strange things, too. Have you ever talked to your son about the investigation?"
Glare,Soichiro,"Of course not. I've never once revealed classified information to my family. Besides, I don't get to see them too often these days, and usually as soon as I get home, all I can do is sleep."
Glare,Ryuzaki,I understand
Glare,Ryuk,Where exactly are we going?
Glare,Ryuk,"Light, don't ignore me when I'm talking to you or I'll get mad. [Light starts checking his jacket] Huh? [as Light starts to think] Hellooooooo?"
Glare,Light,[thinking] Doesn't look like these clothes have been bugged. I think we're safe.
Glare,Ryuk,[flailing] Yoo-hoooooooo!
Glare,Light,"Listen to me! There's a very strong possibility that there are wiretaps, 'n' maybe surveillance cameras, hidden throughout my house."
Glare,Ryuk,"Really? But that piece of paper was still in your door, wasn't it?"
Glare,Light,"That's true, but I left the paper in the door in a way that it would be obvious to anyone entering the room. The real test is the handle."
Glare,Ryuk,It is?
Glare,Light,"[as he explains, a split-screen showing a diagram of what he is describing is shown] When that door is closed, the doorhandle automatically returns to a horizontal position, and it won't go any higher than that. But whenever I close the door, I adjust it slightly. Instead of letting it sit horizontally, I lower it by about five millimeters. When I get home and I try to open the door, if the handle is all the way up, I can be fairly certain that someone was in my room. That method alone doesn't tell me if my door was actually opened. So I put a mechanical pencil led in place as well."
Glare,Ryuk,So what do you do with it?
Glare,Light,"It goes on the hinge. After I close the door, I take the pencil led and rest it on the hinges in such a way that it will break if the door happens to be opened by anyone. Normally, I take it out myself when I get back home. When I got home from school today, I noticed that the pencil lead was broken."
Glare,Ryuk,"Now that you mention it, I do remember that."
Glare,Light,"First the door handle, then the lead. I know someone was in there today."
Glare,Ryuk,Maybe it was your mother.
Glare,Light,My family wouldn't have noticed the piece of paper. What's suspicious is that someone took the time to put it back in the door.
Glare,Clerk,"Hi, there, can I help you?"
Glare,Ryuk,What's this all about? Are you buying a book about wiretaps and surveillance so you can figure this mess out?
Glare,Light,"By the way, Ryuk, what about your apples?"
Glare,Ryuk,"Apples? [gasps] That's right! Surveillance cameras! Once the apple's in my mouth, no one can see it, but while I'm holding it, it looks like it's floating."
Glare,Light,"I thought so. You told me that Shinigami can't die, so I guess it won't kill you to stop eating apples for a while."
Glare,Ryuk,"[desperately] Agh! Don't you think that's a bit much? Come on! I never told you this, but apples are to me, what cigarettes and alcohol are to humans. Do you see what I'm sayin'? I even get withdrawal symptoms."
Glare,Light,Oh yeah? What kind of symptoms.
Glare,Ryuk,"My body gets all twisted, I do handstands. [doing a handstand] It's not pretty!"
Glare,Light,I don't need to see that.
Glare,Ryuk,[sighs] I know.
Glare,Light,"Okay, here's the thing. Unfortunately, I already gave L the hint that Shinigami love apples, so I just can't afford to take the risk."
Glare,Ryuk,When did you...?
Glare,Light,"[stopping in front of his house] If it's so important for you to eat apples, you'll have to find out where all the cameras are hidden. If you're lucky, you might find a blind spot where you can eat them without being seen."
Glare,Ryuk,Huh...
Glare,Light,"Alright, let's go."
Glare,Ryuk,[flying to the top floor] Yeah! A camera search! [thinking] Sounds so interesting.
Glare,Ryuk,"Oh... Oh! Uh! [looking around] I, have to find the cameras"
Glare,Soichiro,I can't believe my son is looking at those magazines.
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Hm, it's normal for a seventeen-year-old. But it seems contrived. It's too obvious. The only reason he didn't want anyone in his room was because he had these magazines? That's what he wants us to think."
Glare,Soichiro,Hey. That's my son you're talking about. Are you honestly telling me that you suspect him?
Glare,Ryuzaki,I do suspect him. That's why I placed wiretaps and surveillance cameras in your house and the deputy director's house.
Glare,Ryuk,Huh? I found a camera in the air conditioner!
Glare,Light,"Hmm. [thinking So they really put cameras in here. They must have bugged the place as well. Even if this is the Kira case, I didn't think the Japanese police would ever go this far. This must be L's idea. Which means they've narrowed down their list of suspects. By now they must have figured out that it was someone who Raye Penber was investigating, or they wouldn't have gone to all this trouble. [sitting up and closing magazine][aloud] Hmm... Man, these covers mislead you all the time. [thinking] No. Given the situation, it's safer if I just assume I'm their prime suspect, and the only one being watched. It'll be okay. Luckily, I've prepared for this kind of situation."
Glare,Soichiro,"Oh, Light..."
Glare,Sayu,"Hey, Light, come on! Dinner is ready!"
Glare,Hideki Ryuga,I love you. Always
Glare,Woman,[drops her umbrella and whimpers]
Glare,Sayu,"Hideki Ryuga. I swear, he's perfect! How come no one in my class is like that?"
Glare,Sachiko,"Sayu, just eat your dinner."
Glare,Sayu,[over speakers] I'll eat later!
Glare,Ryuzaki,"[on phone] Hello, Mr. Aizawa? Are the Kitamuras watching television right now?"
Glare,Aizawa,"[over phone] Yes. [cut to Aizawa] He's not home, but the other four are watching while they eat dinner. It's channel four."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Watari, please contact the broadcasters and tell them to play our message."
Glare,Watari,Very well. Understood.
Glare,Hideki Ryuga,"That's right, my parents met... [rest is inaudible]"
Glare,Sayu,"[offscreen] Huh? What's this? [cut out] ICPO? They're saying that, ""In response to the Kira murders, Interpol has decided to dispatch a force of fifteen hundred investigators to Japan. The investigators were drawn from the law enforcement agencies of its member nations."" Fifteen hundred investigators? Whoa!"
Glare,Light,"[thinking] Chances are they've got cameras in the living room as well. Regardless of whether this news is real or not, it's obvious they're just trying to revoke a reaction from me. L, this is the exact same trick you used last time. [aloud] The ICPO sure is stupid."
Glare,Sayu,Huh?
Glare,Light,"[scoffs] I mean, there's no point in making this announcement. If they're going to send all these people here to investigate, shouldn't they keep it a secret?"
Glare,Light,"[over speakers] Even if the FBI agents who were secretly investigating were killed by Kira, why would this be any different? If you ask me, this is nothing more than a desperate attempt to shock Kira, in the hopes that he'll reveal himself somehow. Quite frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if Kira sees right through this."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Hmm... [chuckles] Your son's clever, isn't he?"
Glare,Soichiro,"Huh. Well, yes."
Glare,Light,"[over speakers] Thanks for dinner, Mom."
Glare,Sayu,Huh? You're eating a bag of chips? You just had dinner! Your good looks are gonna go down the drain if you keep that up.
Glare,Light,It's a late-night snack for studying.
Glare,Ryuk,"I think that's it, Light. I found every camera they put in the house. I guess Shinigami get tired when they work hard. Now let me explain where they all are. It's a little bit complicated, so listen up. There's nothing I hate more than explaining something twice."
Glare,Light,"Alright, it's time for me to hit the books."
Glare,Ryuk,There sure are a lot of cameras in this room. I counted sixty-four in total. I guess whoever put them in here expected you to find at least some of them.
Glare,Light,[thinking] It has to be L. He had no qualms about putting a death raw inmate in his place when he declared war on me. It's pretty clear he doesn't know any limits.
Glare,Ryuk,Ugh. What I wanna know is how am I going to be able to eat apples?
Glare,Light,"[thinking] Obviously, that's impossible now, isn't it?"
Glare,Ryuk,"Oh, yeah. I guess you can't talk in here. But we'd better discuss this outside tomorrow."
Glare,Light,"Okay. I think I'm getting the hang of this now. [thinking] Judging by the number of cameras he's planted, he's planning to make a decision within a short period of time. Any normal person would slip under these circumstances, [""Kuroi Light"" stops] but it won't be that easy with me, L. [as he rips his bag of chips open:] This, is the closest you will get! [laughs softly]"
Glare,Ryuk,"[on the floor, laughs]"
Glare,Light,"[thinking] I've set things up so that criminals will continue to die over the next three weeks. L is aware by now that Kira can control the times of death of his victims. Therefore, to avoid suspicion, L needs to see that criminals whose names are being broadcast continue to die while I have no access to that information."
Glare,Ryuk,[getting up into a handstand][panicking] Oooh! The symptoms are starting! Agggggh!
Glare,Light,"[cont'd][thinking] I'm gonna show you, L!"
Glare,Light,"[cont'd][thinking] With Ryuk's information and my preparations, I can continue to kill criminals who names are broadcast on the news, while masquerading as a typical high school student studying for his entrance exams. Just watch me, L. I'll solve equations with my right hand and write names with my left. I'll take a potato chip and eat it!"
Glare,Ryuzaki,"After dinner, your son just goes back to studying without turning on the TV or his computer?"
Glare,Soichiro,It's because the entrance exams are five days away.
Glare,Ryuzaki,Hmm...
Glare,Light,"[thinking] Now, a criminal who I should have no knowledge of will die of a heart attack in forty seconds. And the witness to my alibi is L himself. [crunches up bag of chips and throws them in the trash][aloud] Alright. Just a little bit longer."
Glare,Watari,Ryuzaki.
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Yes? What is it, Watari?"
Glare,Watari,"[looking at note] A few minutes ago, a bank clerk being questioned on suspicion of embezzlement and a purse-snatcher being held in a detention center were broadcast on the news. They both just died of sudden, inexplicable heart attacks."
Glare,Soichiro,[stands up] It's him again.
Glare,Ryuzaki,"While all that was happening, at your home, your wife and daughter were watching television. When that was over, they turned the TV off and didn't watch anything afterwards. From just past seven-thirty until now, eleven o'clock, your son's done nothing but study. Kira needs a name and a face. Without those, he can't kill. So I suppose anyone who didn't watch the news can't be Kira, right?"
Glare,Soichiro,You said it yourself. That means my family has been cleared!
Glare,Ryuzaki,It doesn’t make sense that Kira would kill two petty criminals right after their identities were broadcast.
Glare,Soichiro,[gasps]
Glare,Ryuzaki,"I know it's only the first day after the cameras were installed, but the Yagami household almost seems too innocent to me. Hmm..."
Glare,Sachiko,"[off-screen] Light, are you up yet?"
Glare,Light,"[yawning] Yeah, I'm awake."
Glare,Sachiko,"Today's garbage day, so if you've got any bring it down with you, okay?"
Glare,Light,[opening door and walking out with trashcan] What a pain.
Glare,Sachiko,"[chuckles] What are you talking about? You usually say, ""there's no need to remind me, Mom."""
Glare,Light,"[walking away] Yeah, yeah."
Glare,Light,Another beautiful day.
Glare,Ryuk,"Well, I can't say for sure whether you're extremely generous or just a spoilt brat.But didn't that mini-LCD TV cost you four hundred bucks?"
Glare,Sachiko,Good morning!
Glare,Light,"[chuckles] Perfect. There's no need for me to be worried. After all, this is proof that they don't have anything on me yet. So this whole thing is nothing more than a contest between L and I. A battle of wits."
