## Intoduction
Despite not being an avid fan of anime in comparison to Webtoons or Manhuas or even Manhwas, I thought Death Note would be quite interesting to do a sentiment analysis on. Perhaps this choice was guided by the lessons that I learnt from the manga as a child. Lessons on the fact that people are not infallible, it is easy to get lost in the pursuit of oneâ€™s goals and the fact that there is no absolute right or wrong. This is my very first work on this topic and , so feel free to correct me on anything weird or improvement ideas.

I would early on like to pay my tribute to:
- **Inspiration:** This is heavily inspired by Xaviers work analysing the sentiments on [Star Wars](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/analyzing-star-wars-movie-scripts) data set
- **Data Source:** I went through the tedious process of scraping the transcripts from [Anime de English](https://anime-de-english.com/category/transcripts/) and making them slightly intelligible. 
- **Author and illustratoe:**  Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata whose sheer imagination and artistic skill created one of the most iconic manga and anime series.
