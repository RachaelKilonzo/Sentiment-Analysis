## Intoduction
Despite not being an avid fan of anime in comparison to Webtoons or Manhuas or even Manhwas, I thought Death Note would be quite interesting to do a sentiment analysis on. Perhaps this choice was guided by the lessons that I learnt from the manga as a child. Lessons on the fact that people are not infallible, it is easy to get lost in the pursuit of oneâ€™s goals and the fact that there is no absolute right or wrong. This is my very first work on this topic and , so feel free to correct me on anything weird or improvement ideas.

I would early on like to pay my tribute to:
- **Inspiration:** This is heavily inspired by Xaviers work analysing the sentiments on [Star Wars](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/analyzing-star-wars-movie-scripts) data set
- **Data Source:** I went through the tedious process of scraping the transcripts from [Anime de English](https://anime-de-english.com/category/transcripts/) and making them slightly intelligible. 
- **Author and illustratoe:**  Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata whose sheer imagination and artistic skill created one of the most iconic manga and anime series.

- **Light and L** as expected have the largest percentage of dialogue in the anime. They are the main characters. An antagonist and protagonist
- **Misa, Soichiro, Matsuda and Ryuk** come in as the second most talkative group.
- **Aizawa, Near, Higuchi and Rem** rounding up the 10 most talkative characters.

Variations of the root word kill (killed, kill and killing), death (die, death, dies) and wrong are predominant as the most popular negative words while right, like, well and good are the most popular positive words. This is correlation to the archetypes of the storyline. The questions on right and wrong actions in relation to human life. Death and murder as commited by Light.
### NRC Lexicon
