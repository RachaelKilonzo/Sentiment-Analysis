Sentiment Analysis on the classical anime Death Note.
Despite not being an avid fan of anime in comparison to Webtoons or Manhuas or even Manhwas, I thought Death Note would be quite interesting to do a sentiment analysis on. Perhaps this choice was guided by the lessons that I learnt from the anime as a child. Lessons on the fact that people are not infallible, it is easy to get lost in the pursuit of oneâ€™s goals and the fact that there is no absolute right or wrong. This is my very first notebook on this topic, so feel free to correct me on anything weird or improvement ideas
