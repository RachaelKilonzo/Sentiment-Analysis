Confrontation,Light,The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die…
Confrontation,Takuo,[Laughs] Woo!
Confrontation,Lady,Help me!
Confrontation,Light,Now… what will happen?
Confrontation,Light,"The Death Note, it's for real!"
Confrontation,Ryuk,Any human who's used a Death Note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity.
Confrontation,Light,I want the world to know of my existence. That there's someone passing righteous judgement on the wicked! And I… I will become the God of this New World!
Confrontation,English teacher,"He found himself overwhelmed with happiness and satisfaction, [Girl talking: I have no idea what he was thinking coming to my house, but I am so through with him.] [Boy: Seriously? So what happened with your dad after that?] knowing that, at long last, his dream had finally come true. Alright then. Yagami? Please recite this line for us."
Confrontation,Light,"Sure. Having finally made his dream a reality, he was overwhelmed. Both by the magnitude of his achievement, and by the joy and happiness that it brought him."
Confrontation,,Light sits back down.
Confrontation,English teacher,"That was very well done, but I'm not surprised, of course. Absolutely flawless. Very good. Well then, we'll leave it at that for today."
Confrontation,,The students groan and get up from their seats. The bell rings.
Confrontation,Ryuk,"[Outside] I thought it'd never end. How do you do this every day? It's so boring here. Hey, where're you going? Hey, Light! Are you listening to me?"
Confrontation,Light,"[Quietly] Don't talk to me. Unlike you, people can still hear me when I talk out loud."
Confrontation,Ryuk,"Heh, well aren't you boring."
Confrontation,Young man,"Hey, what's up, Light? We were just going to head down to the—"
Confrontation,Light,"Sorry, I'm a little busy today."
Confrontation,Ryuk,"You don't have anything to do. Aren't you just going to go home and hang out in your room, as usual?"
Confrontation,Light,"What are you talking about? Of course I have something to do. Yes, something very important."
Confrontation,,Scene change. A news broadcast is playing on the TV in Light's bedroom. Light is writing names down in his Death Note.
Confrontation,News Reporter,"There was more violence across the city today. Another stabbing, this time at a restaurant in the heart of the Kabuki-cho district of Shinjuku."
Confrontation,,"Ryuk sits on Light's bed, munching on an apple."
Confrontation,Ryuk,"[Bites an apple] Mmm. Hey, Light. [Swallows] I'm talking to you."
Confrontation,Light,What is it?
Confrontation,Ryuk,Why are you working so hard?
Confrontation,Light,"I can't afford to waste any time. I have a very small window to write names in this notebook. I only have from when I get home from school until I go to bed. I still need to sleep so I can maintain my average and stay at the top of my class. Obviously, I can't be sleeping in class. Plus, there's all the studying at home and at cram school. I can't let myself get too tired. It will start to affect my health and my mental performance. If I'm serious about trying to create an ideal world that's free from evil then I need to make the most of my time."
Confrontation,,The door knob turns then clicks as it stops.
Confrontation,Sayu,"Huh? Weird. Hey, Light, what's going on? Why is your door locked?"
Confrontation,Light,It's Sayu. What is it?
Confrontation,Sayu,Can you help me with my homework?
Confrontation,Light,"Uh, yeah. Okay."
Confrontation,,Light puts the Death Note in his desk drawer and goes to open the door.
Confrontation,Sayu,"We're doing quadratic equations in math. Sorry to interrupt. I know you're studying right now, but I'm like the only person in my class who doesn't get this stuff. Thanks so much!"
Confrontation,Light,No problem.
Confrontation,Ryuk,"I'd be careful if I were you. If anyone else touches that notebook you've got hidden in the drawer right now, they'll be able to see me too."
Confrontation,Light,"[Thinking] Huh, he waits till now to mention that important detail?! Damn Shinigami."
Confrontation,Sayu,What's wrong? Are you alright?
Confrontation,Light,Hm? It's nothing. So what exactly don't you understand? What are you stuck on?
Confrontation,Sayu,Um…well…I think all of it.
Confrontation,,Scene change to ICPO headquarters.
Confrontation,Delegate 1,"There have been fifty-two deaths that we're aware of, and that's just in the past week."
Confrontation,Delegate 2,Every single one of them involved a heart attack.
Confrontation,Delegate 1,They were all criminals who were either being held in prison or who were wanted by police for outstanding crimes. And I think it's safe to say there are other criminals whose deaths are unaccounted for.
Confrontation,Delegate 3,In which case the death toll could be well over 100.
Confrontation,Matsuda,"Uh… morning, Chief. They started the meeting without you."
Confrontation,Soichiro,That's fine. I had to take an urgent call from headquarters.
Confrontation,Delegate 2,"At any rate, these were criminals who were probably facing execution sooner or later. Perhaps we shouldn't be—"
Confrontation,Delegate 1,"Why should it matter if it's a criminal or someone innocent?! Last time I checked, murder was still murder!"
Confrontation,Delegate 3,It's still too early to consider these a homicide.
Confrontation,Delegate 1,"Then how did all these people have heart attacks at the exact same time?! That's not coincidence, it's murder!"
Confrontation,Delegate 3,You think it's possible to simultaneously kill all these people in different locations?
Confrontation,Delegate 4,We're treating this as an elaborate murder plot that's been carried out by a large organization.
Confrontation,Delegate 5,"If it is a large organization, I'm sure I'm not alone in suspecting the FBI or CIA."
Confrontation,Delegate 6,[Off-screen] I dare you to say that again!
Confrontation,Delegate 7,"Now, now, this is not the time to be joking around! We need to confirm that these are indeed homicides and not coincidences!"
Confrontation,Delegate 3,"How? Autopsy results show that in all of these cases, the victims died of a sudden heart attack."
Confrontation,Delegate 4,Investigating a series of heart attacks is pointless. I don't see what else we can learn.
Confrontation,Delegate 5,"Absolutely. If these people had been shot or stabbed, at least we'd have something to go on."
Confrontation,Delegate 1,"If that's the case, it looks as if we'll have no choice but to bring in L."
Confrontation,,The room quiets down and people begin murmuring amongst themselves.
Confrontation,Matsuda,"Uh, Chief. What's this ""L"" they're talking about?"
Confrontation,Soichiro,"Right, I forgot that it's your first time at this conference. We don't know L's real name or whereabouts. In fact, we still don't even know what he looks like. However, he's managed to solve every case he's ever taken on. And he's tackled some of the greatest mysteries this world has even known. He hides in the shadows, but he's the best of the best. A last resort. Our trump card."
Confrontation,Delegate 8,"But I've heard this ""L"" is extremely arrogant and has tended to only take on cases that he's personally interested in."
Confrontation,Delegate 9,"That's exactly right! Besides, we don't even know how to contact him!"
Confrontation,Watari,L is already on the move.
Confrontation,,"The room goes quiet as Watari enters, hidden in a black trench coat and hat."
Confrontation,Watari,"Gentlemen, L has already begun his investigation into these incidents."
Confrontation,Matsuda,Huh? Who's that?
Confrontation,Soichiro,That man's the only known person who can contact L. Nobody knows his true identity either.
Confrontation,Watari,Please be silent. L would now like to address the delegates.
Confrontation,,Watari opens a laptop.
Confrontation,L (voice altered via voice distorter),Greetings to all of you at the ICPO. I…am L.
Confrontation,,Scene change. The camera pans across the outside of a run-down building.
Confrontation,Ryuk,[Inside] What are we doing here anyway? I don't understand why we're sneaking around this dump. Tell me.
Confrontation,Light,"Isn't it obvious? Anyone who touches the Death Note will be able to see you. I can't afford to carry something this dangerous with me anymore. Up until now, I thought that if my family ever saw the notebook, I can tell them I was keeping records of various criminals in preparation for becoming a detective one day. But I'm walking a very fine line right now. I don't want to think about it, but if I make one mistake, I might end up killing my own family."
Confrontation,,Light mixes two liquids which then ignite. Scene change back to ICPO headquarters.
Confrontation,L,"The difficulty of this case lies on its unprecedented scope. And make no mistake. We are witnessing an atrocious act of mass murder, one that is unforgivable. This case cannot be solved without the full cooperation of the ICPO. That is all of the police organizations you represent throughout the world. You need to make the decision to fully support the investigation at this meeting. Also, I require additional cooperation from Japan's National Police Agency."
Confrontation,Soichiro,Huh? What? Why Japan in particular?
Confrontation,L,"Whether the guilty party is an individual or a group, there's a strong possibility that they are Japanese. And even if they are not, we can be sure they're hiding in Japan."
Confrontation,Soichiro,What is all this based on?
Confrontation,L,"Why Japan, you ask? I think I will be able to provide you with proof of that after I directly confront the culprit."
Confrontation,Soichiro,A direct confrontation?
Confrontation,L,"At any rate, I would like to set up the investigation headquarters in Japan."
Confrontation,,Scene change. Light's room. Light relaxes into his desk chair.
Confrontation,Light,That was easier to make than I thought it'd be.
Confrontation,Ryuk,Huh? Does that mean you were able to hide the notebook?
Confrontation,Light,Yeah. I hid it right here in this drawer.
Confrontation,Ryuk,But it doesn't seem to be particularly well hidden. You left the key in the lock.
Confrontation,Light,And that's the whole point. I intentionally left the key in the most noticeable place I could think of.
Confrontation,,"Light opens the drawer, revealing a brown leather diary."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Isn't that just a regular diary?
Confrontation,Light,"That's what it is. I'm guessing that once most people find the diary inside my desk, that'll probably satisfy their curiosity. But the real key is this. Just an everyday item you'd expect to find lying around on my desk. A regular ball-point pen, and all I need is this part."
Confrontation,,He removes the ink reservoir of the pen.
Confrontation,Ryuk,So that's the key?
Confrontation,Light,"Yeah. If you look closely, you'll find there's a small hole underneath the drawer. Then you just insert this."
Confrontation,,"Light inserts the ink filler into the hole. It lifts up the bottom of the drawer, revealing the Death Note in the real drawer."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Aha. A fake bottom. The diary will distract most people so I doubt anyone will find it.
Confrontation,Light,But that's not all.
Confrontation,Ryuk,Oh?
Confrontation,Light,"Even if someone figures out there's a fake base, I've set things up so that there's no way they could get their hands on the notebook. You see, once the ink reservoir is inserted, it accesses an insulator, preventing the flow of electricity around this circuit. When the fake base of the drawer's put back, this piece of rubber also prevents the flow of electricity. However, if someone were to try and force the bottom of the drawer open, the circuit would connect and now would ignite the gasoline contained in this thin plastic casing, instantly setting the notebook on fire. The way I’ve got it set up, all the evidence will be completely destroyed. If I'm ever questioned, I'd say that I was hiding the real diary because I didn't want anyone to see it. It sounds like a pretty believable excuse. I mean, it is my diary after all."
Confrontation,Ryuk,"I've heard of humans finding Death Notes in the past and typically the biggest problem they had was finding a good place to hide it. But you, Light, you're probably the first to have given it this much thought. Though, it's a pretty risky setup from the look of it. If you make even the slightest mistake, you could be badly burned."
Confrontation,Light,"Risky? You say the strangest thing sometimes, Ryuk. This whole thing has been a risk since the very beginning, from the moment I obtained the Death Note. I'm sorry, but compared to that, this doesn't even qualify as a risk to me. In fact, it actually protects me. It all comes down to a choice: would I prefer to be executed or deal with a little house fire?"
Confrontation,,Commercial break
Confrontation,,Scene change to Daikoku Private Academy.
Confrontation,Announcer,"Last night in the West Tokyo penitentiary, Naoki Koro Kitayama, originally sentenced to fifteen years for armed robbery, was reported to have died of a sudden heart attack at the age of thirty-two. This is just the most recent death in the steadily growing number of cases involving inmates dying of heart attacks."
Confrontation,Student 1,This is unbelievable. Criminals are dropping like flies lately.
Confrontation,Student 2,"It's a little scary, but at the same time, it's kind of cool."
Confrontation,Student 1,Sure. Just make sure you don't do anything bad.
Confrontation,Student 3,I won't be surprised if the police were behind this.
Confrontation,Student 2,No way. The police don't have that kind of power.
Confrontation,Student 1,Don't you know about him?
Confrontation,Student 3,Huh? About who?
Confrontation,Student 1,"Kira. You know, Kira."
Confrontation,Student 4,I wonder who's gonna be killed next.
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room. Light looks at his computer.
Confrontation,Light,"Ryuk, you should check this out."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Huh?
Confrontation,,Ryuk moves to stand behind Light.
Confrontation,Light,Websites like this are popping up everywhere lately.
Confrontation,Ryuk,The Legend of Kira the Savior. Huh. Sounds pretty cool. Is this about you?
Confrontation,Light,"Yeah. I think they've taken the name ""Kira"" from the English word ""killer."" Can't say I'm too happy about that, but it looks like that's the name they've decided to give me. When I search the word Kira, I'm pulling up tons of sites just like this one. The media hasn't picked up on it. They're still calling this a succession of unexplained deaths among the world's most hardened criminals. But…the people of the world can already sense that there's something happening. They know there's someone out there passing righteous judgment."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Oh?
Confrontation,Light,"Human beings are like that, Ryuk."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Huh.
Confrontation,Light,"Although this would probably never happen in school, let's say that students were asked to discuss whether bad people deserve to die. Well, you can bet that everyone will give the politically correct answer."
Confrontation,,Scene change to Daikoku Private Academy.
Confrontation,Girl,It's just wrong to kill people.
Confrontation,,Scene change. Back to Light's room.
Confrontation,Light,"That's what they are bound to say. Of course, that's the correct response to give, right? Humans are always trying to maintain appearances when they're in public. That's just how we are. But this is how they really feel. Most are too afraid to support me as they're worried about what others would think. Many would rather deny my existence. But on the Internet, where you can remain anonymous, support for Kira is growing. Maybe people are afraid to say it out loud, but they all understand what's happening. Someone's making the bad guys disappear one by one. Those who have done no wrong are cheering for Kira in their hearts because they have nothing to fear, while those who have done wrong are on the run. They are forced to hide from an unknown enemy. This is how it should be. It's perfect. Everything is going just like I planned."
Confrontation,,Time change. Later that afternoon in Light's room.
Confrontation,TV Announcer,"We'd like to apologize for the interruption. As of now, we're bringing you a live worldwide broadcast from Interpol, ICPO."
Confrontation,Ryuk,Hm? What's this?
Confrontation,Light,Interpol?
Confrontation,TV Announcer,We now take you live to the ICPO.
Confrontation,Lind L. Tailor,"I head up an International Police Task Force which includes all member nations. I am Lind L. Tailor, otherwise known as L."
Confrontation,Light,Huh? Who is this guy?
Confrontation,,Scene change to the Japan National Police Agency headquarters.
Confrontation,Soichiro,So this is how it all begins.
Confrontation,Matsuda,"But, sir, I don't get it. He's never actually shown his face before, right? Why would he choose to do it now?"
Confrontation,Soichiro,It must mean L's serious about this.
Confrontation,Matsuda,Hm.
Confrontation,Soichiro,"[Thinking] L, we've followed every single one of your orders. Now, it's time for you to prove what you said to the ICPO."
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,Lind L. Tailor (on television screen),"Criminals around the world are being murdered by a serial killer. I consider this crime to be the most atrocious act of murder in history. I will not rest until the person or persons responsible are brought to justice. Kira, I will hunt you down. I will find you."
Confrontation,Ryuk,He seems certain he'll catch you.
Confrontation,Light,"Hm. That fool. He'll never find me. [Picks up the Death Note and stands] He'll have to get this first. And as long as the police don't find it, there won't be any evidence to convict me, which means catching me will be absolutely impossible. [Relaxes in his chair] I anticipated that the police would get involved and that something like this might happen."
Confrontation,Lind L. Tailor,"Kira, I've got a pretty good idea what your motivation might be, and I can guess what you hope to achieve. However, what you're doing right now is evil."
Confrontation,,Light gasps and stands up.
Confrontation,Light,"You think…I'm evil? I am justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil! I'm the one who will become the god of a new world that everyone desires! All those who oppose that god, they are the ones who are truly evil!"
Confrontation,,Light opens the Death Note and readies a pen. He looks back up at the television.
Confrontation,Light,"I guess you're just too stupid, L. Too bad. This could've been a lot more interesting if you'd only been a bit smarter."
Confrontation,,Light writes Lind L. Tailor's name in large letters and laughs maniacally. He looks back at the screen.
Confrontation,Light,I'll show the world what happens when you cross me. The entire world is watching…L.
Confrontation,,Light glances at his watch.
Confrontation,Light,Five more seconds.
Confrontation,,The second hand on the watch ticks audibly as Light counts down. The camera changes between the two scenes.
Confrontation,Light,Four…three…two…one…
Confrontation,,"Lind L. Tailor collapses, dead. Light gasps then laughs maniacally."
Confrontation,Light,What's wrong? You've got nothing else to say?
Confrontation,,"Two suited men with black sunglasses remove Lind L. Tailor's body from view as Light continues to laugh. L's symbol suddenly flashes on screen, silencing Light."
Confrontation,L (through voice modifier),"Ah. I had to test this, just in case, but I-I never thought it would actually happen. Kira…it seems you can kill people without having to be there in person. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't just witnessed it. Listen to me, Kira. If you did, indeed, kill Lind L. Tailor, the man who you just saw die on television, I should tell you that he was an inmate whose execution was scheduled for today. That was not me."
Confrontation,Light,What?
Confrontation,L,"The police arrested him in absolute secrecy, so you wouldn't have heard of him on TV or through the internet. It appears not even you have access to information about these types of criminals."
Confrontation,,Ryuk laughs and looks at Light.
Confrontation,Ryuk,He got you there.
Confrontation,,The scene changes between L's symbol and the hidden face of a man speaking into a microphone.
Confrontation,L,"But I assure you, L is real. I do exist. Now…try to kill me!"
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,Light,You…you bastard!
Confrontation,,Scene change to Japan National Police Agency headquarters. L still challenging Kira.
Confrontation,L,"What's wrong? Go ahead! Come on, right now! Kill me!"
Confrontation,Officer 1,What the hell is going on? L is taking this too far.
Confrontation,Officer 2,"Are you trying to kill yourself, L?!"
Confrontation,,"Scene change to the city center. People have gathered around large screen, listening to L's challenge."
Confrontation,Bystander 1,What's going on?
Confrontation,Bystander 2,"Look, it's Kira versus L!"
Confrontation,Bystander 3,Huh? What?
Confrontation,,The crowd begins to murmur.
Confrontation,Bystander 4,This is freaky.
Confrontation,Bystander 5,Amazing.
Confrontation,Bystander 6,"Do it, Kira!"
Confrontation,Bystander 7,"Someone, stop this!"
Confrontation,Bystander 8,What's the matter?!
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,L,Can't you do it?
Confrontation,,Light stares at the TV incredulously.
Confrontation,L,"Well Kira, it seems you can't kill me after all."
Confrontation,,"Ryuk laughs once again. Scene change to the man with the microphone, L."
Confrontation,L,So there are some people you can't kill. You've given me a useful hint.
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,L,"Let me return the favor. I'll tell you something that I think you'll find interesting. Although this was announced as a worldwide broadcast, the truth is, we are only broadcasting in the Kanto region of Japan. I had planned to broadcast this message around the world until we found you, but it looks like that won't be necessary. I know now where you are."
Confrontation,Ryuk,[Laughs] This L guy is pretty good.
Confrontation,L,"The police treated your first killing as an unrelated incident, but in actuality, the first of your victims was a suspect in Shinjuku."
Confrontation,,Flashback to the scene of the incident.
Confrontation,L,"Of all the criminals that recently died of heart attacks, this one's crime was, by far, the least serious. Furthermore, his crime was only ever reported inside Japan."
Confrontation,,Present day. Scene change to L's location.
Confrontation,L,"I used that information to deduce this much. You are in Japan and your first victim was little more than an experiment, which means you haven't been killing for very long."
Confrontation,,Light gasps. Scene change to the city center.
Confrontation,L,"We decided to broadcast in Kanto first because of its large population, and, luckily, we found you."
Confrontation,,Scene change to Japan National Police Agency headquarters.
Confrontation,L,"To be completely honest with you, I never expected that things would go this well, but…it won't be too long now before I am able to sentence you to death."
Confrontation,Matsuda,L has…certainly lived up to his reputation.
Confrontation,Soichiro,"Mmhmm. He proved that Kira exists, that the deaths were murders, and that he is here in Japan."
Confrontation,,Scene change to Light's room.
Confrontation,L,"Naturally, I am very interested to know how you're able to commit these murders without being present…but I don't mind waiting a little bit longer. [Scene change to L's location.] You can answer all of my questions when I catch you… Let's meet again soon, Kira."
Confrontation,,"Scene change to Light's room. The broadcast cuts out and leaves the screen snowy, a fuzzy sound filling the quiet room."
Confrontation,Light,"Really? He's gonna sentence me to death? Sounds interesting. I accept your challenge, L."
Confrontation,Ryuk,[Thinking] Each of them has to hunt down the other without knowing the other's name or face. And the first one whose identity is revealed will die. Humans are so much fun.
Confrontation,,The scene constantly changes between Light's room and L's location.
Confrontation,Light,L…
Confrontation,L,Kira…
Confrontation,,Split screen.
Confrontation,Both Light and L,I will hunt you down wherever you're hiding and I will eliminate you!
Confrontation,Light,I am…
Confrontation,L,I am…
Confrontation,Both,Justice!
Confrontation,Light,"I'm not the one who's going to find L. I can let the police do that for me. And when they do, that's when I'll eliminate him! Looks like I may be able to provide you with more entertainment, Ryuk."
