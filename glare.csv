Episode Name,Characters,Dialogue
Glare,Aizawa,That was footage from surveillance cameras at the station. The death of one of the FBI agents is captured on here. [groans]
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Let's see the following scenes again: Raye Penber passing the ticket gate on his way in, then him boarding the train, then finally the part where he dies on the platform. [bites into ice cream]"
Glare,Aizawa,Okay. [sorting through surveillance tapes] Let's see...
Glare,Matsuda,I think it's next to that.
Glare,Aizawa,"Oh, here it is."
Glare,Matsuda,"[reviewing document] Um, so based on the records I have here, Raye Penber comes through the west entrance of Shinjuku Station at 3:11 PM. Then at 3:13 he boards a train on the Yamanote Line. But even if he was following someone at that time, I think it's going to be very difficult for us to draw any real conclusions from the blurry video. Then at exactually 4:42 P.M. a—"
Glare,Matsuda,"[cont'd] Nnn. Oh, thank you, Watari."
Glare,Matsuda,"Uuuumm, and at 4:42 P.M., he exits the train at Tokyo station and dies on the platform"
Glare,Ryuzaki,"It's quite strange, don’t you think?"
Glare,Aizawa,[happily with ice cream] Hah...
Glare,Soichiro,I'm sorry. What do you find strange?
Glare,Matsuda,"Yeah, what is it. Did you notice something?"
Glare,Ryuzaki,"[licks ice cream] Mmm. [swallows] We know that Raye Penber got on the train and then an hour and a half later he got off and died on the platform. But the Yamanote Line only takes an hour to complete its circuit. And more importantly, there's the envelope."
Glare,Aizawa,"Uh, whaddya mean?"
Glare,Ryuzaki,He's holding what looks like an envelope when he passes through the ticket gate.
Glare,Aizawa,"[gasps] You're right! It's there, under his arm! [looks at other screen] But in the footage right before his death, it's gone! I can't believe you actually caught that!"
Glare,Soichiro,"[grabs paper] Well, I don't see an envelope on this list of his personal effects."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Which means it was left on the train. And if you watch closely, at the very end here... [fastforwards tape to Raye dying on platform] it seems like he's straining to look inside the train before the doors close. You can see right here."
Glare,Soichiro,"If that's the case, do you think it could mean something?"
Glare,Ryuzaki,Wouldn't it be interesting if Kira was on that train?
Glare,Soichiro,That's impossible!
Glare,Ryuzaki,"I admit, I find it hard to believe as well. There's no reason for Kira to come to the scene of his own crime when he can kill from a distance. [takes breath] Well... maybe he was counting on us to make that assumption, and figured he could get away with such a bold move. [eats ice cream] Mmm..."
Glare,Ryuk,"[offscreen] What's going on with you, Light?"
Glare,Ryuk,[cont'd] You haven't stopped writing criminals' names in the Death Note for four days straight. So what are you trying to prove? I don't see the point of writing these names weeks in advance. I've never seen the Death Note used like this.
Glare,Light,"Consider it insurance. Suppose the son of the Detective Superintendent of the NPA was hospitalized. If criminals stop dying at the same time, it wouldn't be difficult to connect the two."
Glare,Ryuk,So that's what this is.
Glare,Light,Are you sure that I can use any date as long as it's before the end of a person's predetermined lifespan?
Glare,Ryuk,"Well, I can't guarantee it, because we Shinigami don't normally work that way, but I suppose any time before the end of their lifespan should work."
Glare,Light,"I really can't count on you, can I?"
Glare,Ryuk,Ya got that right.
Glare,Watari,"[on phone] Yes? Yes, would you please hold for a moment? [to Ryuzaki] Ryuzaki, it's Ukita at the NPA. He says he's on the phone with someone from the tip-line who has information for us."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Right. Then give Ukita the number for line five and ask him to have the informant call that line instead. It'll be safer that way. Mr. Matsuda, it's okay for you to turn your cellphone on now. Actually, please turn it on right away."
Glare,Matsuda,"Uh, sure."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"[using fake voice] Yes, this is Suzuki, head of Kira investigation Public Information Division. [pauses][in real voice] Raye Penber's fiancée? Naomi Misora..."
Glare,Ryuzaki,[cont'd] I've heard that name before...
Glare,Ryuzaki,"[gasps] [thinking] So it's her. She's from the Los Angeles BB Murder Case. That's right! She was working under me. I guess she must have come to Japan with her fiancé. [hangs up cellphone and hands it to Matsuda][aloud] Well, apparently she's been missing since the day after her fiancé died."
Glare,Matsuda,I'm sure that anyone in her situation would be pretty depressed. Was it...?
Glare,Aizawa,Suicide.
Glare,Ryuzaki,"No. The Naomi Misora I knew was strong. Not to mention she was also an excellent FBI agent. If anything, it's more likely that she'd be trying to catch Kira. It appears she came to Japan with Penber, it's possible that she may have found a lead... [thinking] If that's the case, did Kira manage to get to her first? [aloud] Everyone. At this point, I'd like to focus our investigation on only those people who Raye Penber was tailing. In particular, he was assigned to two police officers and those closest to them."
Glare,Soichiro,Very well. Who are these two individuals he was investigating?
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Deputy Director Kitamura, along with Detective Superintendent Yagami and their families."
Glare,Soichiro,[gasps]
Glare,Ryuzaki,"At this stage, I'd like to place wiretaps and surveillance cameras in both households."
Glare,Light,"[thinking] I have to make sure there's no evidence left on this computer, just in case someone goes through it. Now I just have to hide these clippings from the Death Note in here."
Glare,Ryuk,"It seems you're pretty skilled with your hands. I bet you're pretty popular with the girls, aren't you?"
Glare,Light,"Skill has nothing to do with it. It's your looks that count. I'm guessing you're not that popular, are you?"
Glare,Ryuk,[upset] Huh?
Glare,Matsuda,Surveillance cameras? Ryuzaki!
Glare,Aizawa,"I don't see how you could even consider this. If this got out, we'd have a civil rights scandal on our hands! We'd all lose our jobs."
Glare,Ryuzaki,You told me you'd be willing to risk your lives for this investigation. But you wouldn't risk your jobs?
Glare,Matsuda,"Uh, uh..."
Glare,Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, what are the odds that Kira is in one of those households."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Maybe ten percent. No, it's closer to five percent."
Glare,Matsuda,"Seriously? I'm sorry, but it's not worth the risk."
Glare,Soichiro,No.
Glare,Aizawa and Matsuda,[gasp]
Glare,Soichiro,"[cont'd] Of all the people we've investigated so far, not one of them seemed even the least bit suspicious. Even if there's only a one percent chance, we simply can't afford to ignore it."
Glare,Matsuda,Chief?
Glare,Soichiro,"I don't have to tell you how offended I am to learn my family is under suspicion. Having said that, just go ahead with it."
Glare,Aizawa and Matsuda,[gasp]
Glare,Soichiro,"[cont'd] And make sure you install them everywhere. I don't wany blind spots in the house, and that includes the bathroom."
Glare,Ryuzaki,Thank you very much. That was my intention
Glare,Aizawa,"Come on, Chief, you don't have to agree to this!"
Glare,Matsuda,"Yes, he's right! Think about your family! You have a wife and daughter at home, don't you?"
Glare,Soichiro,"[spins around][angrily] Yes, I'm well aware of that fact! But there is no point of doing this if we can't be thorough! Now I suggest you keep quiet!"
Glare,Matsuda,I'm sorry.
Glare,Soichiro,"No, it's okay. Excuse me."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"As a courtesy to the chief and his family, only he and I will conduct surveillance of their home. Watari, how long will it take to prepare the wiretaps and cameras we need?"
Glare,Watari,"Well, starting tomorrow, I can set them up at any time, provided we know when both houses will be empty."
Glare,Light's friend,"[offscreen] See ya later, Light!"
Glare,Light,"Yeah, see ya tomorrow. [he grabs the doorhandle to find it's locked][thinking] What? No one's home yet?"
Glare,Light,[taking off shoes] I'm home!
Glare,Light,Huh? Hmm...
Glare,Ryuk,"How's it going? I don't think anyone else is in the house right now. Do you wanna play some videogames? [Light lays down on his bed, ignoring Ryuk] Come on, it's been a while!"
Glare,Ryuk,You listening?
Glare,Soichiro,I don't believe it. I never knew he went to such great lengths. What could he be hiding in their that he doesn't want anyone else to see?
Glare,Ryuzaki,"For a seventeen-year-old kid, I wouldn't say this kind of behavior's particularly abnormal. When I was his age, I did strange things, too. Have you ever talked to your son about the investigation?"
Glare,Soichiro,"Of course not. I've never once revealed classified information to my family. Besides, I don't get to see them too often these days, and usually as soon as I get home, all I can do is sleep."
Glare,Ryuzaki,I understand
Glare,Ryuk,Where exactly are we going?
Glare,Ryuk,"Light, don't ignore me when I'm talking to you or I'll get mad. [Light starts checking his jacket] Huh? [as Light starts to think] Hellooooooo?"
Glare,Light,[thinking] Doesn't look like these clothes have been bugged. I think we're safe.
Glare,Ryuk,[flailing] Yoo-hoooooooo!
Glare,Light,"Listen to me! There's a very strong possibility that there are wiretaps, 'n' maybe surveillance cameras, hidden throughout my house."
Glare,Ryuk,"Really? But that piece of paper was still in your door, wasn't it?"
Glare,Light,"That's true, but I left the paper in the door in a way that it would be obvious to anyone entering the room. The real test is the handle."
Glare,Ryuk,It is?
Glare,Light,"[as he explains, a split-screen showing a diagram of what he is describing is shown] When that door is closed, the doorhandle automatically returns to a horizontal position, and it won't go any higher than that. But whenever I close the door, I adjust it slightly. Instead of letting it sit horizontally, I lower it by about five millimeters. When I get home and I try to open the door, if the handle is all the way up, I can be fairly certain that someone was in my room. That method alone doesn't tell me if my door was actually opened. So I put a mechanical pencil led in place as well."
Glare,Ryuk,So what do you do with it?
Glare,Light,"It goes on the hinge. After I close the door, I take the pencil led and rest it on the hinges in such a way that it will break if the door happens to be opened by anyone. Normally, I take it out myself when I get back home. When I got home from school today, I noticed that the pencil lead was broken."
Glare,Ryuk,"Now that you mention it, I do remember that."
Glare,Light,"First the door handle, then the lead. I know someone was in there today."
Glare,Ryuk,Maybe it was your mother.
Glare,Light,My family wouldn't have noticed the piece of paper. What's suspicious is that someone took the time to put it back in the door.
Glare,Clerk,"Hi, there, can I help you?"
Glare,Ryuk,What's this all about? Are you buying a book about wiretaps and surveillance so you can figure this mess out?
Glare,Light,"By the way, Ryuk, what about your apples?"
Glare,Ryuk,"Apples? [gasps] That's right! Surveillance cameras! Once the apple's in my mouth, no one can see it, but while I'm holding it, it looks like it's floating."
Glare,Light,"I thought so. You told me that Shinigami can't die, so I guess it won't kill you to stop eating apples for a while."
Glare,Ryuk,"[desperately] Agh! Don't you think that's a bit much? Come on! I never told you this, but apples are to me, what cigarettes and alcohol are to humans. Do you see what I'm sayin'? I even get withdrawal symptoms."
Glare,Light,Oh yeah? What kind of symptoms.
Glare,Ryuk,"My body gets all twisted, I do handstands. [doing a handstand] It's not pretty!"
Glare,Light,I don't need to see that.
Glare,Ryuk,[sighs] I know.
Glare,Light,"Okay, here's the thing. Unfortunately, I already gave L the hint that Shinigami love apples, so I just can't afford to take the risk."
Glare,Ryuk,When did you...?
Glare,Light,"[stopping in front of his house] If it's so important for you to eat apples, you'll have to find out where all the cameras are hidden. If you're lucky, you might find a blind spot where you can eat them without being seen."
Glare,Ryuk,Huh...
Glare,Light,"Alright, let's go."
Glare,Ryuk,[flying to the top floor] Yeah! A camera search! [thinking] Sounds so interesting.
Glare,Ryuk,"Oh... Oh! Uh! [looking around] I, have to find the cameras"
Glare,Soichiro,I can't believe my son is looking at those magazines.
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Hm, it's normal for a seventeen-year-old. But it seems contrived. It's too obvious. The only reason he didn't want anyone in his room was because he had these magazines? That's what he wants us to think."
Glare,Soichiro,Hey. That's my son you're talking about. Are you honestly telling me that you suspect him?
Glare,Ryuzaki,I do suspect him. That's why I placed wiretaps and surveillance cameras in your house and the deputy director's house.
Glare,Ryuk,Huh? I found a camera in the air conditioner!
Glare,Light,"Hmm. [thinking So they really put cameras in here. They must have bugged the place as well. Even if this is the Kira case, I didn't think the Japanese police would ever go this far. This must be L's idea. Which means they've narrowed down their list of suspects. By now they must have figured out that it was someone who Raye Penber was investigating, or they wouldn't have gone to all this trouble. [sitting up and closing magazine][aloud] Hmm... Man, these covers mislead you all the time. [thinking] No. Given the situation, it's safer if I just assume I'm their prime suspect, and the only one being watched. It'll be okay. Luckily, I've prepared for this kind of situation."
Glare,Soichiro,"Oh, Light..."
Glare,Sayu,"Hey, Light, come on! Dinner is ready!"
Glare,Hideki Ryuga,I love you. Always
Glare,Woman,[drops her umbrella and whimpers]
Glare,Sayu,"Hideki Ryuga. I swear, he's perfect! How come no one in my class is like that?"
Glare,Sachiko,"Sayu, just eat your dinner."
Glare,Sayu,[over speakers] I'll eat later!
Glare,Ryuzaki,"[on phone] Hello, Mr. Aizawa? Are the Kitamuras watching television right now?"
Glare,Aizawa,"[over phone] Yes. [cut to Aizawa] He's not home, but the other four are watching while they eat dinner. It's channel four."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Watari, please contact the broadcasters and tell them to play our message."
Glare,Watari,Very well. Understood.
Glare,Hideki Ryuga,"That's right, my parents met... [rest is inaudible]"
Glare,Sayu,"[offscreen] Huh? What's this? [cut out] ICPO? They're saying that, ""In response to the Kira murders, Interpol has decided to dispatch a force of fifteen hundred investigators to Japan. The investigators were drawn from the law enforcement agencies of its member nations."" Fifteen hundred investigators? Whoa!"
Glare,Light,"[thinking] Chances are they've got cameras in the living room as well. Regardless of whether this news is real or not, it's obvious they're just trying to revoke a reaction from me. L, this is the exact same trick you used last time. [aloud] The ICPO sure is stupid."
Glare,Sayu,Huh?
Glare,Light,"[scoffs] I mean, there's no point in making this announcement. If they're going to send all these people here to investigate, shouldn't they keep it a secret?"
Glare,Light,"[over speakers] Even if the FBI agents who were secretly investigating were killed by Kira, why would this be any different? If you ask me, this is nothing more than a desperate attempt to shock Kira, in the hopes that he'll reveal himself somehow. Quite frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if Kira sees right through this."
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Hmm... [chuckles] Your son's clever, isn't he?"
Glare,Soichiro,"Huh. Well, yes."
Glare,Light,"[over speakers] Thanks for dinner, Mom."
Glare,Sayu,Huh? You're eating a bag of chips? You just had dinner! Your good looks are gonna go down the drain if you keep that up.
Glare,Light,It's a late-night snack for studying.
Glare,Ryuk,"I think that's it, Light. I found every camera they put in the house. I guess Shinigami get tired when they work hard. Now let me explain where they all are. It's a little bit complicated, so listen up. There's nothing I hate more than explaining something twice."
Glare,Light,"Alright, it's time for me to hit the books."
Glare,Ryuk,There sure are a lot of cameras in this room. I counted sixty-four in total. I guess whoever put them in here expected you to find at least some of them.
Glare,Light,[thinking] It has to be L. He had no qualms about putting a death raw inmate in his place when he declared war on me. It's pretty clear he doesn't know any limits.
Glare,Ryuk,Ugh. What I wanna know is how am I going to be able to eat apples?
Glare,Light,"[thinking] Obviously, that's impossible now, isn't it?"
Glare,Ryuk,"Oh, yeah. I guess you can't talk in here. But we'd better discuss this outside tomorrow."
Glare,Light,"Okay. I think I'm getting the hang of this now. [thinking] Judging by the number of cameras he's planted, he's planning to make a decision within a short period of time. Any normal person would slip under these circumstances, [""Kuroi Light"" stops] but it won't be that easy with me, L. [as he rips his bag of chips open:] This, is the closest you will get! [laughs softly]"
Glare,Ryuk,"[on the floor, laughs]"
Glare,Light,"[thinking] I've set things up so that criminals will continue to die over the next three weeks. L is aware by now that Kira can control the times of death of his victims. Therefore, to avoid suspicion, L needs to see that criminals whose names are being broadcast continue to die while I have no access to that information."
Glare,Ryuk,[getting up into a handstand][panicking] Oooh! The symptoms are starting! Agggggh!
Glare,Light,"[cont'd][thinking] I'm gonna show you, L!"
Glare,Light,"[cont'd][thinking] With Ryuk's information and my preparations, I can continue to kill criminals who names are broadcast on the news, while masquerading as a typical high school student studying for his entrance exams. Just watch me, L. I'll solve equations with my right hand and write names with my left. I'll take a potato chip and eat it!"
Glare,Ryuzaki,"After dinner, your son just goes back to studying without turning on the TV or his computer?"
Glare,Soichiro,It's because the entrance exams are five days away.
Glare,Ryuzaki,Hmm...
Glare,Light,"[thinking] Now, a criminal who I should have no knowledge of will die of a heart attack in forty seconds. And the witness to my alibi is L himself. [crunches up bag of chips and throws them in the trash][aloud] Alright. Just a little bit longer."
Glare,Watari,Ryuzaki.
Glare,Ryuzaki,"Yes? What is it, Watari?"
Glare,Watari,"[looking at note] A few minutes ago, a bank clerk being questioned on suspicion of embezzlement and a purse-snatcher being held in a detention center were broadcast on the news. They both just died of sudden, inexplicable heart attacks."
Glare,Soichiro,[stands up] It's him again.
Glare,Ryuzaki,"While all that was happening, at your home, your wife and daughter were watching television. When that was over, they turned the TV off and didn't watch anything afterwards. From just past seven-thirty until now, eleven o'clock, your son's done nothing but study. Kira needs a name and a face. Without those, he can't kill. So I suppose anyone who didn't watch the news can't be Kira, right?"
Glare,Soichiro,You said it yourself. That means my family has been cleared!
Glare,Ryuzaki,It doesn’t make sense that Kira would kill two petty criminals right after their identities were broadcast.
Glare,Soichiro,[gasps]
Glare,Ryuzaki,"I know it's only the first day after the cameras were installed, but the Yagami household almost seems too innocent to me. Hmm..."
Glare,Sachiko,"[off-screen] Light, are you up yet?"
Glare,Light,"[yawning] Yeah, I'm awake."
Glare,Sachiko,"Today's garbage day, so if you've got any bring it down with you, okay?"
Glare,Light,[opening door and walking out with trashcan] What a pain.
Glare,Sachiko,"[chuckles] What are you talking about? You usually say, ""there's no need to remind me, Mom."""
Glare,Light,"[walking away] Yeah, yeah."
Glare,Light,Another beautiful day.
Glare,Ryuk,"Well, I can't say for sure whether you're extremely generous or just a spoilt brat.But didn't that mini-LCD TV cost you four hundred bucks?"
Glare,Sachiko,Good morning!
Glare,Light,"[chuckles] Perfect. There's no need for me to be worried. After all, this is proof that they don't have anything on me yet. So this whole thing is nothing more than a contest between L and I. A battle of wits."
