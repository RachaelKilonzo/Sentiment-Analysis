Episode Name,Characters,Dialogue
Pursuit,Soichiro,[V.O.] What? I don't believe this. Another twenty-three victims yesterday? Are these confirmed?
Pursuit,L,"[V.O.] As soon as began to suspect that Kira might be a student, the pacing of the killings changed, as if to contradict that theory. This can only mean that Kira has access to police information."
Pursuit,Light,"[V.O.] When L discovers that I'm somehow getting confidential information, he'll be obligated to start investigating the police to find the source of the leak."
Pursuit,Ryuk,[V.O.] You're being followed by another human. He's watching you right now.
Pursuit,Light,[V.O.] That's a problem. I'll have to get rid of him as soon as possible.
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Because through a Shinigami's eyes a human's name can be seen above their head. Not only that, we see there lifespan as well. However, if a Shinigami drops his Death Note, and a human picks it up, he can grant that human the eyes of a Shinigami. The price for having a Shinigami's eyes is half of that person's remaining lifespan. That's all it is. So... what'll it be, Light? Is it a deal?"
Pursuit,Shinigami 1,Has anyone seen Ryuk around?
Pursuit,Shinigami 2,Maybe he was serious about losing his Death Note.
Pursuit,Shinigami 3,[O.S.] It was probably picked up by some human before he could get to it.
Pursuit,Shinigami 4,No way. Then he'd be stuck there 'til the end of that human's life or until the Death Note was destroyed. That could take a while.
Pursuit,Armonia Justin Beyondormason,Yeah. I can't picture Ryuk doing something so boring.
Pursuit,Shinigami 5,[O.S.] Do you know what? I actually heard he was carrying two Death Notes.
Pursuit,Shinigami 6,"[O.S.] Seriously, why would he need two?"
Pursuit,Armonia Justin Beyondormason,Beats me. I'll never understand that guy.
Pursuit,Light,"So the price for receiving the eyes of the Shinigami is no more than half of my remaining lifespan? [pauses] That's it, right?"
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Yes. Well then, do we have a deal or not?"
Pursuit,Light,Ryuk. [pauses] This deal is... out of the question.
Pursuit,Ryuk,Huh?
Pursuit,Light,"Let's get this straight. [cut back] My plan is to create an ideal new world free from evil and all criminals, and I intend to reign as a god in that new world for a very long time. I might consider the deal if it lengthened my life, but not if I die sooner. I figured you of all people should know I wouldn't take this deal."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Yeah. I still felt I should tell you that the deal existed, just in case. Anyway, I've done my part. I don't need you complaining I didn't tell you this earlier on."
Pursuit,Light,"This is what you call ""telling me early on""? Doncha you think you're a little late? I don't see why you couldn't'a told me this when we met. Or better yet, you could've simply included it in the instructions for the Death Note."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Uh, good point. [thinking] He's not the slightest bit daunted by the fact that I'm a Shinigami. He doesn't suck up to me, and he seems to have no problem giving me a hard time."
Pursuit,Light,"[getting up from his desk and walking away] Well, you sure there's nothing else you want to tell me ""ahead of time,"" [pauses as he lays back onto his bed] ""Shinigami""?"
Pursuit,Ryuk,"No, nothing else. [thinking] Eh, probably."
Pursuit,Light,Really? That's too bad.
Pursuit,Ryuk,Whaddya mean?
Pursuit,Light,"You know, Ryuk, I might've seriously considered the deal if you'd offered me wings instead of eyes. Just the idea of flying 'round freely in the sky sounds very god-like. After all, it's been mankind's dream since antiquity to be able to fly."
Pursuit,Ryuk,[slightly surprised] You'd stand out if you sprouted wings and flew around. Not to mention the police would have no trouble finding you.
Pursuit,Light,"[laughs softly] I was only joking. Anyway, if I keep bargaining for eyes and wings and whatever else, next thing you know I'm going to end up becoming a real Shinigami. Though who knows? I bet that could be pretty interesting."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"I wouldn't worry. Even without the eyes and wings, you're already a worthy Shinigami."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"[V.O.] The Shinigami realm is slowly rotting. We lead meaningless and empty lives. And the only reason we still take human lives is because we're afraid to die ourselves. The truth of the matter is that we no longer even know why we exist. In fact, I doubt there's any reason for our existence at all."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"[cont'd] What I'm saying is, compared to that, you're becoming a much more impressive Shinigami."
Pursuit,Light,"I don't know about that. I mean, from what you're telling me it, it sounds like I'm doing a lot more work than they are, but uh I don't want to be compared to a Shinigami. I'm a human using this Death Note to make the world a better place for humans. [flips through the Death Note] But I wouldn't necessarily say the Shinigami realm is meaningless to humans either."
Pursuit,Ryuk,Huh? Why do you say that?
Pursuit,Light,"Well, just think about it. Whenever a Shinigami like you comes to the human world once ever hundred—no more like every thousand years—the human world changes dramatically. The existence of the Shinigami Realm is extremely significant."
Pursuit,Ryuk,Really?
Pursuit,Light,"And you told me just now that the Shinigami realm is slowly rotting, right? Well, when you return from this world, why not use what you've learned here to try and change it for the better?"
Pursuit,Ryuk,"[after a pause] Well, Light, I'm not sure why I never noticed this until now, but you're quite the positive thinker."
Pursuit,Light,"[laughs softly] Yeah, of course I am. That's why I'm using the Death Note to create a better world. You have to be a positive thinker to even attempt something like this."
Pursuit,Light,[cont'd] That's it. I got it.
Pursuit,Ryuk,Got what? What's this about?
Pursuit,Light,I think I just figured out how to find out the name of the guy who was following me today.
Pursuit,Ryuk,How're ya gonna do that?
Pursuit,Light,"I'm gonna use the rules of the Death Note to my advantage. I already know that if I write down a cause of death, I've got six minutes and forty seconds to record the conditions and exact time of death. First, I need to know exactly how far I can go in terms of specifying the details of death. ...This should be interesting."
Pursuit,Soichiro,"Yeah, it's me. ...Another six inmates were found dead last night? ...All were heart attacks? It's him... What? [an officer gasps] Bizarre behavior before they died? Could you be more specific? What do you mean? So they didn't just die from heart attacks."
Pursuit,Caller,"No, what I'm saying is they all died of heart attacks, but it wasn't quite that simple."
Pursuit,Caller,"[cont'd] Before one of them died, he drew a pentagram on the wall of his cell with his own blood. [letter] Another left a letter, but it doesn't seem to be a will or anything meaningful. [photo] As for the third victim, he escaped from his cell and ran all the way to the staff bathrooms before he died."
Pursuit,L,"What is it, Watari?"
Pursuit,Watari,"[muffled output] Three more heart attack victims, but the circumstances of their deaths are different from what we've seen thus far."
Pursuit,L,"What do you mean by ""different""?"
Pursuit,Watari,[muffled output] I'm sending you a copy of a letter as well as pictures taken at the scene.
Pursuit,L,Okay.
Pursuit,L,"It sounds like he was afraid that Kira would fine him. It's believable that our victim might have been genuinely afraid and wrote this, but... We know Kira can control the time of death. What if he can also determine the actions in the moments leading up to death? In which case..."
Pursuit,L,[distorted by voice changer] Here.
Pursuit,Soichiro,[standing up] Huh?
Pursuit,L,"[distorted] We can't release details of these men's deaths to the media. As far as they're concerned, these are just heart attacks."
Pursuit,Soichiro,Huh...
Pursuit,L,"[distorted] I have reason to believe that Kira was performing some kind of ""test"" using these criminals. And if that's the case, we'd only be giving him the results of this information if we put it public."
Pursuit,Soichiro,Right. I understand.
Pursuit,Officer 1,So now he's experimenting on his victims?
Pursuit,Officer 2,Horrible.
Pursuit,Soichiro,"He's playing with people's lives, as if all this was just a game. It's unforgivable."
Pursuit,L,If Kira is really using criminals as test subjects... what is he trying to achieve?
Pursuit,Light,"Look at this, Ryuk. I think we're in luck. The results of yesterday's little ""test"" of ours has been downloaded onto my dad's computer. And these results are just as I suspected. The Death Note will work for what I have in mind."
Pursuit,Ryuk,Whaddya mean by that?
Pursuit,Light,One of 'em escaped and ran into the bathroom I had specified in the Death Note.
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] Another one drew the same symbol I had drawn in the bathroom before he died. And finally [the half of the screen with the cell is replaced with the previously seen letter] a third wrote the same letter I had written in the Death Note, word for word."
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] All three did exactly what I intended them to do. For the other three inmates, I purposely wrote conditions that were virtually impossible."
Pursuit,Ryuk,Huh?
Pursuit,Light,"With the first one, I wrote that he would die in front of the Eiffel Tower in one hour. However, everyone knows it's physically impossible to go from a prison in Japan to Paris, France in only one hour. Since this couldn't happen, he simply died of a heart attack in prison. The next was supposed to draw an exact picture of L's face on the prison wall. This also didn't happen. You can't draw someone you've never seen before."
Pursuit,Ryuk,[O.S.] Makes sense.
Pursuit,Light,"[V.O.] With the last one, I tried something slightly different. I specified that he would write a note that read, ""I know that L is suspicious of the Japanese police."""
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] To be honest, I actually expected this one to work, but it didn't end up happening. Which means, it's impossible to make someone write what they don't already know. Or at the very least, it has to be the kind of thing they could come up with on their own. Basically, even the Death Note can't do the impossible, but as long as it's within the realistic limits of what that person might do, I can control them as much as I want before they die."
Pursuit,Ryuk,That's very clever. But what's all this leading to? What's the point?
Pursuit,Light,"These latest victims will no doubt keep L and the police guessing. Even as we speak, he's probably trying to decipher all the clues I left for him. Especially that little note. That absolutely meaningless dying message."
Pursuit,L,"If Kira used those criminals to start an experiment of some sort, it means he's about to start something. If he moves now, there's a good chance the FBI will notice someone acting. But perhaps he has a different goal in mind altogether."
Pursuit,L,[cont'd] [O.S.] Could the pentagram and this letter be some kind of message?
Pursuit,L,[cont'd] [O.S.] Is this it?
Pursuit,Light,Alright. Time for the real thing.
Pursuit,Ryuk,"""Real thing""?"
Pursuit,Light,Yesterday on the news they said this drug addict tried to rob a bank but was unsuccessful.
Pursuit,Light,[cont'd] [O.S.] He attacked a few people and then ran away emptyhanded. I'll use him.
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] It's kinda last minute, but I'm sure I can find someone. I got a few people in mind."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"""A few people."" For what?"
Pursuit,Light,"You'll see. [putting phone to his ear] Believe it or not, I'm actually a rather popular guy, Ryuk."
Pursuit,Yuri,"Hello? ...Huh? Light? Oh, morning."
Pursuit,Light,[thinking] He's still following me. This whole thing would just be a waste of time if he wasn't following me.
Pursuit,Yuri,[waving] [calls out] Light!
Pursuit,Ryuk,A date?
Pursuit,Light,Yeah.
Pursuit,Light,[cont'd] It's a date no matter how you look at it. I'm sure even my stalker will see it that way.
Pursuit,Ryuk,"But this isn't just a date, is it? You said that you'd figured out a way o find your stalkers name. So tell me, what do you plan on doing?"
Pursuit,Light,"Huh? Come on, didn't you see what I wrote in the Death Note? I explained it in great detail."
Pursuit,Ryuk,No. Doing that would take all the fun out of it.
Pursuit,Light,"In that case, just be patient and watch what happens. [he approaches the bus shelter; to Yuri:] Sorry, did I keep you waiting?"
Pursuit,Yuri,"No, not at all. Anyway, I haven't been to Space Land since junior high! [clings to Light's arm] I'm so excited. And the best part is I have you all to myself!"
Pursuit,Light,"Uh, yeah."
Pursuit,Stranger,[thinking] During the week he goes to school and cram school at night.
Pursuit,Stranger,"[cont'd] [thinking] Dates on his day off. Normal kid, just a hardworking senior in high school. Chief Yagami's son, Light Yagami. [Stranger jots down notes in small notebook] No cause for suspicion."
Pursuit,Stranger,"[cont'd] [thinking] At any rate, I'll be done with my surveillance today, and that'll be it."
Pursuit,Yuri,"I don't get it, Light. Didn't you say you weren't going out until entrance exams were over?"
Pursuit,Light,That was before I scored number one on the national practice exams.
Pursuit,Yuri,[groans] [playfully] You're such a nerd. [giggles]
Pursuit,Light,"[thinking] It's him. He's here. Seven passengers excluding him, no one's in the way. Everything should go smoothly."
Pursuit,Osoreda,Stay in your seats unless you want to die.
Pursuit,Stranger,[thinking] A bus jacking? You gotta be kidding me.
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Everybody shut up! If anybody moves, I'm putting a bullet in their head. [to Sasaki] Alright, driver, you listen to me. I know you've got the number for Space Land's office on ya. Call 'em!"
Pursuit,Sasaki,O-okay.
Pursuit,Sasaki,"[on the phone] This-this is Sasaki, calling from Bus 1-7-4. [cut back]"
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Tell 'em what's going on—and no tricks, either."
Pursuit,Sasaki,"M-my bus has been hijacked, and he's holding a gun to my head."
Pursuit,Osoreda,[grabbing phone from Sasaki] Gimme that. [on the phone] You heard what he said. Now you listen up!
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Have a female staff member bring all the cash from Space Land's cash from yesterday. I know it's there. Have her meet us two bus stops from the park and don't make me wait. If you try to mess with me at all or try to get the police involved, I swear I'll kill everyone one of these passengers."
Pursuit,Yuri,Huh?
Pursuit,Light,"[V.O.] Yuri, don't be scared. As soon as he turns around, I'm going to grab the gun out of his hand."
Pursuit,Stranger,"Don't be stupid. That's risky. [leans closer] If it comes to that, I'll take care of it."
Pursuit,Stranger,"It's okay. We don't have to pass notes back and forth. As long as we keep it down, he won't be able to hear our voices over the sound of the engine."
Pursuit,Light,Do you have any proof you're not his accomplice? Why should we trust you?
Pursuit,Yuri,[timidly] Accomplice?
Pursuit,Light,"Yes, I've read about this before. The first hijacker comes in like he's working alone. Meanwhile, the second one pretends to be a hostage and stays in the very back just in case something goes wrong. [softly] What's the matter."
Pursuit,Yuri,[softly] You... you really think he is one?
Pursuit,Stranger,"[thinking] I... I have no choice. I'm sure Light Yagami isn't Kira. If he was, he could just kill this guy with a heart attack."
Pursuit,Stranger,Here's my proof. [Light takes it] Take a look.
Pursuit,Light,"[thinking] FBI? I see. L needed an outsider, so he got the FBI to investigate anyone connected to the Japanese Police Force. His name is... Raye Penber."
Pursuit,Light,I trust you. And I guess for the time being I won't bother asking what an FBI agent is doing on the bus in the first place. Do you have a gun?
Pursuit,Raye,"Yeah, I've got one."
Pursuit,Light,"So if it comes down to it, I can rely on you, right?"
Pursuit,Raye,Yes.
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Get the hell up, you old hag! You want me to shoot you right now?"
Pursuit,Raye,[gasps] [thinking] That's right. This guy. His face was all over the local news just a few days ago.
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Look at me when I'm talking to you, grandma! I said shut up! [growls]"
Pursuit,Raye,[cont'd] [thinking] Some junkie. He tried to rob a bank and then killed three people before he got away. He's extremely dangerous.
Pursuit,Light,"[smugly thinking] We're safe. He won't shoot us. In fact, he's not gonna do anything."
Pursuit,Osoreda,"[shouting] Don't move, you little punk!"
Pursuit,Osoreda,"[shouting] What the hell is that? [pause] Eh, smartass! [picking up note] You guys were planning something back here, weren'cha?"
Pursuit,Raye,"[thinking] Damn it! If he sees that note from before, he'll find out that Light was planning to jump him and take his gun away!"
Pursuit,Osoreda,"Pft. Plans for a date, huh? [crumples and tosses note to Light] Stupid kid."
Pursuit,Light,[thinking] Gotcha.
Pursuit,Osoreda,Huh?
Pursuit,Osoeda,[shouting frantically] Wh-who the hell are you? You in the very back? What do you think you're doing?
Pursuit,Osoreda,[shouting frantically] Don't mess with me!
Pursuit,Osoreda,[shouting frantically] How long have you been hiding back there?
Pursuit,Ryuk,What's this? [tilts head] You're talking to me? [steps forward] So you mean you can actually see me right now?
Pursuit,Osoreda,"[gasps] Stay there, you! You—Keep away from me, you freak!"
Pursuit,Raye,[thinking] This isn't good. He's hallucinating! [quickly leans forward] [shouting] Everyone! Get down!
Pursuit,Ryuk,"Oh, I get it! That little note that Light ""accidentally"" dropped, was actually torn from the pages of the Death Note itself. Since he tricked this guy into TOUCHING the paper, he's the only other one on the bus who can see me. [walking towards Osoreda] That's so smart!"
Pursuit,Osoreda,[stumbling back] [shouting frantically] Get away!
Pursuit,Soichiro,"Sorry, pal. I'm a Shinigami, so I'm afraid your bullets aren't gonna kill me."
Pursuit,Ryuk,"""Anyone who touches the Death Note can see me."" ""I have to stay 'til the Death Note is finished or you die—whichever comes first."" And ""a Shinigami can't die from being shot."" I've said all these things at one time or another. Well, he is the top-ranked student in the country. [Raye gets up from his seat and runs forward] He even used this hijacking as a way to get the guy following him to willingly give up his name."
Pursuit,Osoreda,Stop the bus. [shouting] Let me off!
Pursuit,Light,[thinking] Eleven forty-five on the dot. Everything went just as I planned.
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] ""Kiichiro Osoreda. Accidental death."""
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] ""Boards the 11:31 Space Land-bound bus near the eastern entrance to the park, holding a loaded gun, and attempts to hijack the bus. He sees a horrific phantom and empties his gun trying to kill it. Terrified, he leaves the bus. Immediately afterwards, at 11:45, he dies when struck by a car."""
Pursuit,Light,"[cont'd] [thinking] The Death Note never fails. [cut to Raye] You will be next, Raye Penber."
Pursuit,Light,"[V.O.] It's just as I thought. He doesn't suspect me at all. The remaining investigators will all die of heart attack. Farewell, Raye Penber."
