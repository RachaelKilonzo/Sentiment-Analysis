Unraveling,L,[monotone] I am L.
Unraveling,Soichiro,[thinking]] This is him?
Unraveling,Matsuda,Hmm. He's nothing like he thought I'd be.
Unraveling,Soichiro,"Hmm. [pulls out badge] I'm Yagami, of the NPA."
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Uh, Matsuda."
Unraveling,Aizawa,I'm Aizawa.
Unraveling,Mogi,Mogi.
Unraveling,Ukita,Ukita.
Unraveling,Soichiro,"I'm very sorry we're late. Currently, the five of us are—"
Unraveling,L,Bang!
Unraveling,Task force,Huh?
Unraveling,Matsuda,Uh?
Unraveling,Aizawa,What the hell was that?
Unraveling,L,"Hmm... If I were Kira, you'd be dead Mr. Soichiro Yagami for the NPA."
Unraveling,L,"Kira needs a face and a name in order to commit murder. But I'm sure you've already figured that much out, haven't you? Please, do not give out your names so carelessly. Instead, let's value our lives."
Unraveling,Matsuda,"I knew that he needed a face to kill someone, but I don't remember any evidence that showed that he needed a name, too."
Unraveling,Soichiro,"There's no way to verify if this is related, but criminals whose names were never released publicly or whose names were spelled incorrectly in the media have not been targeted. We briefly went over it at one of our meetings."
Unraveling,L,That's enough small talk for now. Come this way.
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Oh, uh, right."
Unraveling,L,"Please turn off all your cell phones, handhelds, and any other communication devices, and leave them on the table right there."
Unraveling,Aizawa,"What, do you think we're going to be using our cellphones during this meeting to leak information?"
Unraveling,Soichiro,It's alright. Just do as he says.
Unraveling,Matsuda,"[as they all place their cellphones on the table] I realize he's been cautious from the very beginning, but I still can't tell if he trusts us or not."
Unraveling,L,"[taking a seat] No, I just find them distracting. I can't stand it when people's cellphones are ringing while I'm trying to talk. Let me start by saying nobody takes notes on anything that's said in these meetings. That means when we leave headquarters, any information we need is committed to memory. Please, make yourselves comfortable."
Unraveling,Soichiro,Huh. Right.
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Excuse me, L?"
Unraveling,Woman,"Mmm, and from now on I'll have to ask that you stop calling me ""L"". It's ""Ryuzaki"" now, just to be safe."
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Uh, okay, Ryuzaki. If we know that he needs a name and a face to kill, couldn't we cut down on the number of victims by keeping criminals names from the news?"
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"If we do that, we'll only be putting the general public at risk."
Unraveling,Ukita,The general public?
Unraveling,Aizawa,Why?
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Kira is childish, and he hates losing."
Unraveling,Matsuda,But how do you...
Unraveling,Soichiro,Just what do you mean?
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Well, I'm also childish and I hate to lose. That's how I know. [sips tea]"
Unraveling,Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, would you mind being a little more specific for us."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Mnn, early on in the investigation, I tried to provoke Kira with that broadcast."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"[V.O.] Up until then, Kira would only go after criminals. But as we all witnessed, he didn't hesitate to kill my stand-in."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"[V.O.] Also, as soon as I said we knew he was in the Kanto region, in defiance, he made sure his next victims came from within Japan, as if to say, ""'n' what're you gonna do about it?"""
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Mmm. He's met each of my challenges head-on, and he's never missed an opportunity to return the favor. Now what do you think would happen if we tried to use media restrictions to hide criminals from someone like that?"
Unraveling,Matsuda,I guess...
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Hmm. ""If you choose to withhold the names of your worst criminals, I'll kill petty criminals or the innocent. I'm holding the whole world hostage, so who's it gonna be? I'm not the evil one here, but all those who oppose me by hiding criminals? You are truly evil."" [sighs] That's exactly how Kira thinks. In any case, let's look at another way we can use the media to draw him out."
Unraveling,Aizawa,But how?
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"How about something like this? ""Death of FBI agents infuriates the U.S. Latest killings anger the international policing community. Nations agree to send fifteen hundred investigators to Japan."""
Unraveling,Aizawa,Ah...
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"For Kira, this will be way beyond what he faced with the FBI. He'll see everyone as a potential threat. Psychologically, he'll start to feel cornered, and that will cause him to take some kind of drastic action."
Unraveling,Ukita,That's interesting.
Unraveling,Aizawa,"So he'll think there are fifteen hundred, when there are really only seven of us. And since none of these investigators exist, Kira won't be able to kill them."
Unraveling,Ukita,It just might work.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Well, before we celebrate, I'll tell you the rest of my thoughts on the Kira case."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,Kira works alone. He had access to all our classified information.
Unraveling,Aizawa,What evidence do you have that he's working alone?
Unraveling,Soichiro,"Hold on, Aizawa. Let's listen to his entire theory before asking questions."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"We know he needs a name and a face to kill. And to some extent he can control a victim's time of death and their actions before dying. We already know that much. Please keep that in mind [uncaps marker] and listen carefully to what I have to say next. [begins to write] On December fourteenth, twelve FBI investigators enter Japan. Here we are on December nineteenth. Using prison inmates, Kira conducts experiments manipulating his victims' actions before they die. In other words, during this window of only five days, Kira became aware of the FBI's presence and obviously felt threatened. Because he didn't know any of their names or faces, he was at a disadvantage. He needed to know how much control he had over his victims before he could use it against the twelve agents. And as we all know, on December twenty-seventh."
Unraveling,Light,"[thinking] I got a hold of a file which contained all the names and faces of the FBI investigators in Japan, and I succeeded in killing each one of them. It's practically impossible to guess which agent gave the file to Kira, but [brief flashback of interaction with Raye Penber] I have to make sure no one ever finds out that I came into contact with Raye Penber. [writes 12/10 BUS in notebook]"
Unraveling,Ryuk,Huh? How come you're not using the Death Note today? You studying for those entrance exams? [eats apple]
Unraveling,Light,"Those are the least of my worries. Plus, it's a little late to start now."
Unraveling,Ryuk,Oh? Whatcha doing?
Unraveling,Light,December nineteenth to December twenty-seventh. I've been most active during this period.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"During this period, to the best of our knowledge, at least twenty-three individuals died of heart attacks. But these victims were different from Kira's previous targets. They were all alleged criminals, ex-convicts, or suspects in on-going investigations, so legally speaking, they were innocent."
Unraveling,Soichiro,That's true.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"What this indicates, is that Kira had to manipulate these lesser criminals in order to kill those FBI agents. He killed that many people so we'd be unable to kill the decoys from those who were actually used. In truth, he probably only needed a few. He waited eight days so the FBI could investigate other suspects, which meant there'd be no timeline linking him to their deaths. I suspect Kira had to be one of the people being investigated by the FBI between the fourteenth and the nineteenth of December. In fact, I have no doubt. [scribbles out the line he drew between the fourteenth and nineteenth]"
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"These are files provided by the FBI, and they contain additional information you might find useful. For obvious reasons, you're not permitted to take these out of this room, but— [he gasps as he's interrupted]"
Unraveling,Matsuda,"Amazing! There might only be five of us, but with this much information, we should be able to cover a lot of ground."
Unraveling,Aizawa,"We'll split into two teams. One team traces the FBI agents, the other looks at the heart attack victims"
Unraveling,Matsuda,"There weren't that many people who had access to information from headquarters, and of those the FBI only investigated a small group in the first five days"
Unraveling,Aizawa,Yeah. Yeah!
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,So. Does anyone have any questions?
Unraveling,Task force,Huh?
Unraveling,Soichiro,"Actually, Ryuzaki, I do have one question for you. And it pertains to what you said to us earlier about how you hate to lose. Does that fact that you've shown us your face mean that you've lost? By just being here, are you admitting defeat to Kira?"
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"That's right. By showing my face to you know and by sacrificing the lives of twelve FBI agents, I have lost the battle. But I'm not gonna lose the war. This is the first time I've ever put my life on the line. I want to show Kira that we're all willing to risk our lives, if that what it takes, [chuckles and smiles] and that justice will prevail no matter what."
Unraveling,Mogi,"Hey, yeah, that's right!"
Unraveling,Matsuda,I like the sound of that.
Unraveling,Ukita,We can do this!
Unraveling,Aizawa,"Alright, then. Let's do this, Ryuzaki!"
Unraveling,Soichiro,"[thinking] Well, I had my doubts about whether it was really him at first, but there's no mistaking it. This man is L."
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,"Before we go any further, I have to be absolutely sure that none of you are Kira, so I'll need to speak with each of you individually before you leave today."
Unraveling,Aizawa,What's the deal? He still doesn't trust us?
Unraveling,Soichiro,"No, I think it's a fair request. Try and see it from his perspective. Kira's been getting information from our headquarters from the very beginning, so there's a good chance he's one of us."
Unraveling,Matsuda,He's right. Working on this case has given us a chance to see him in person.
Unraveling,Aizawa,[in realization] He's risking his life to be here.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki,[staring out window][thinking] Things are going well. Just one clue—a single decisive factor's all I need.
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] Just one oversight. A single piece of evidence is all it would take. It could cost me my life.
Unraveling,Ryuzaki and Light,Just one thing.
Unraveling,Ryuk,You already finished studying?
Unraveling,Light,"I guess. [thinking] I'll be fine. I haven't missed anything. The biggest risk I've taken so far was that busjacking incident. But they'll never be able to connect it with Kira. Fortunately for me, both the police and L don't know that Kira can kill people by means other than a heart attack. However, if anyone were to discover that, I'd be in a lot of trouble."
Unraveling,Sayu,Whaaaaaat? Does it have to be now?
Unraveling,Sachiko,"[holding out bag of clothes] Your father's been pulling overnighters with now change of clothes, so you're going to bring these to him."
Unraveling,Light,"But Mooooom, I totally promised my friends that I'd go out with them today."
Unraveling,Light,[having walked into the living room] Why don't I go? I could use a break.
Unraveling,Sayu,"Thanks, Light. I owe you one next time! [eats chips and chuckles]"
Unraveling,Ryuk,So I guess this will give you a chance to spy on the police.
Unraveling,Light,"I won't go further than the reception desk. [he opens his trap drawer and retrieves the Death Note, then rips out a page and folds it]"
Unraveling,Ryuk,"Ooooh, you're bringing a page. Planning to kill someone?"
Unraveling,Light,"No, but lately I've been bringing a page with me every time I go out, just in case."
Unraveling,Woman,"[thinking] That day. Raye said that he was planning to go to Shinjuku. That same day, four people died of heart attacks in the Shinjuku area, and there was the bus jacking."
Unraveling,Woman,[thinking] There's no way it was a coincidence.
Unraveling,Woman,[thinking] That's it! Kira can kill in other ways. It doesn't have to be a heart attack.
Unraveling,Voice mail,The mobile customer you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. For voicemail—
Unraveling,Light,That's unusual for Dad. [hangs up] I wonder if he's in a meeting right now.
Unraveling,Woman,"Please, I need to speak directly with someone from the special investigation task force. It's urgent."
Unraveling,Receptionist 1,"I'm sorry ma'am, but I can't help you. As I've told you already, there is no one at task force headquarters right now."
Unraveling,Woman,[sighs]
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] There's no one at headquarters? Dad's cell is turned off. What's going on?
Unraveling,Woman,Can't you contact them somehow? I have information relating to the Kira investigation.
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] The Kira investigation? [approaches]
Unraveling,Receptionist 1,"Look, I'll call headquarters one more time for you. [picks up phone] One moment."
Unraveling,Light,"[approaching desk with bag] Hi, I'm Detective Soichiro Yagami's son, Light Yagami. I brought my father a change of clothes, but it doesn't look like he's in. Can I leave them here?"
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"Sure. Hey, I haven't seen you in a while, Light."
Unraveling,Light,"Oh, I'm sorry, uh..."
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"What, you don't remember? You helped solve the insurance fraud murder investigation. Sometime last year. But hey, no one remembers the receptionist, do they?"
Unraveling,Light,"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm terrible with faces. I just need to sign my name on this form, right?"
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"So Light, does this mean you're gonna be helping us with the Kira investigation, too?"
Unraveling,Light,"Sure! If all goes well, maybe I'll find Kira before L does."
Unraveling,Woman,[looks up at Light][thinking] Find him before L does?
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"[hangs up phone] As I thought, there's no one at headquarters. You're going to have to trust me on this, ma'am. I'll be sure to give them your message as soon as I see them. I promise."
Unraveling,Woman,That's not good enough. I have to tell them in person!
Unraveling,Light,Excuse me?
Unraveling,Light,"My father is actually in charge of the Kira investigation. If you'd like, I could pass your message onto him. His cellphone is off at the moment, but I should be able to contact him soon. A number of FBI agents were just killed, and a lot of detectives have quit the case because they're afraid of Kira, so he's pretty busy right now"
Unraveling,Receptionist 2,"Uh, Light, it's probably better if you don't discuss this with."
Unraveling,Light,"True, but it's practically common knowledge at this point. Besides, I feel like I can trust her. You can almost see it in her eyes. She's a wise and careful person. You heard about what happened, and you must have figured out that the police had a leak of some kind. And that's why you wanted to tell them in person. You thought this through. Well, am I right?"
Unraveling,Woman,[gasps]
Unraveling,Light,"I'm sure my father will call me once he checks his messages. When he does, I'll give you the phone and let you talk to him."
Unraveling,Woman,[they stop] You're sure that's alright?
Unraveling,Light,"Oh yeah. You understand why I can't just give you my father's cell phone number, but I have no problem letting you use my phone to talk to him. You'll have to trust my father and I, which I hope won't be too difficult for you. [laughs]"
Unraveling,Ryuk,[thinking] Why is he so happy?
Unraveling,Woman,[bows] Thank you so much.
Unraveling,Ryuk,"[laughs] She walked right into that one, didn't she?"
Unraveling,Light,"I've gotta say, you must be pretty brave to be getting involved in the Kira case like this."
Unraveling,Woman,"Oh, not really."
Unraveling,Light,"So according to you, is Kira some [clears throat]. Um, we've been talking, and I just realized I don't even know your name. My name is Light Yagami. ""Light""'s written with the character for ""moon"" and ""Yagami"" for the characters ""night"" and ""god"". [chuckles] Kinda weird, huh?"
Unraveling,Shoko,"My name's Shoko Maki. It's written with the characters for ""shining"". ""Ko"" as in ""child"" space and ""ki"" as in ""tree""."
Unraveling,Light,"Miss Maki, right?"
Unraveling,Light,"Miss Maki, I've been thinking about Kira's powers, and I believe they somehow enable him to control his victims before they die."
Unraveling,Shoko,"So do I! It's odd that you say that, because that's exactly what I've been thinking. Kira's able to control their actions before he kills them, but there's more to it. If my analysis so far is correct, Kira can kill in a number of ways, not just with a heart attack."
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] She knows? Who is this woman?
Unraveling,Shoko,"I don't think anyone else knows this yet. But if the police are willing to consider it, I bet it could help them catch Kira."
Unraveling,Light,"You know, that possibility never even crossed my mind. So what you're saying is, any time Kira wants one of his murders to go undetected, he wouldn't use a heart attack."
Unraveling,Shoko,Right. I'm almost positive someone I know may have met Kira.
Unraveling,Light,"Met Kira? [laughs] I'm sorry, but if a person came in saying they met Kira, the police would be more than a little skeptical, to say the least."
Unraveling,Shoko,"[dejectedly] I know. That's why I need to explain it in person to someone at task force headquarters. Otherwise, I'm afraid they'd just write me off"
Unraveling,Light,But wouldn't it be better if your friend spoke to them instead?
Unraveling,Shoko,"He probably would, but he's no longer alive. He was one of the twelve FBI agents who came to Japan to investigate Kira."
Unraveling,Light,[gasps][thinking] An FBI agent. Who met Kira. Could it be?
Unraveling,Shoko,"[echoing] You see, he was also my fiancé. While he was working, he got caught up in a bus-jacking, and I have reason to believe that he met Kira on that bus."
Unraveling,Light,[thinking] Raye Penber. [stops walking]
Unraveling,Shoko,[stops and turns around] Is something wrong?
Unraveling,Light,Nothing. I'm sorry to hear that he passed away. [they continue walking] So what makes you think he met Kira on that bus.
Unraveling,Shoko,"Because eight days after that bus was hijacked, he died, along with the other FBI investigators. The same man had attempted to rob a bank two days before he hijacked that bus, then he dies in an accident? Just like that? [chuckles] I mean, really, what are the odds? I've come to believe that Kira set up that bus-jacking. It was planned to bring him in contact with my fiancé, in order to obtain information on the identities of the other FBI agents, so he could get rid of them all. Anyway, what stands out to me is that the hijacker died in an accident. In other words, it suggests that heart attacks aren't the only way Kira can kill people. [stops at light]"
Unraveling,Light,"Okay, so the busjacker didn't die of a heart attack, and based on that, you're saying Kira has other ways of killing people?"
Unraveling,Shoko,Yes.
Unraveling,Light,"Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that's a bit of a leap of faith."
Unraveling,Shoko,"There's no other way of looking at it. If Kira was controlling the hijacker, chances are, he killed him, too."
Unraveling,Light,I still don't see it.
Unraveling,Shoko,"I've been wondering about that bus-jacking ever since my fiancé first told me about it. After he calmed down, I asked him for details. He didn't mention any names or anything like that, but he told me one thing."
Unraveling,Light,What did he say?
Unraveling,Shoko,That he'd been put in a situation where he had to show his FBI ID to someone.
Unraveling,Light,Hmm...
Unraveling,Shoko,The operation was undertaken secretly without the NPA's knowledge. He wasn't allowed to show his ID. I think whoever saw his ID that day is responsible for the deaths of all the agents.
Unraveling,Ryuk,[thinking] Unbelievable. She figured it out! This must be the oversight Light was worried about.
Unraveling,Light,"I understand. You're the only one who knows any of this, and you want nothing more than to avenge your fiancé by bringing Kria to justice, right? And now you're convinced that Kira can kill without using a heart attack?"
Unraveling,Shoko,Yes.
Unraveling,Light,"There's no doubt in my mind your deductive skills are excellent, but you can't deny that you have a personal interest in the case. Still, your theory is worth looking into. That's for sure. Your testimony could be central to the case."
Unraveling,Shoko,It could.
Unraveling,Light,"If what you're telling me is true, then it'll only be a matter of time before the police catch up with Kira. The person your fiancé showed his ID to on the bus that day, it had to be Kira."
Unraveling,Shoko,[nods] That's right.
Unraveling,Light,That was close. This woman. If she'd spoken to the police before I met her... But it seems there's a god on my side after all. And not just a god of death.
Unraveling,Light,"I have to admit, I'd really love to see how she dies, but I can't be caught following her around. Go on. Hurry to your death."
